Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

[Verse 2]
I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

[Chorus]
Nobody said it was easy
Oh it's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be so hard
I'm going back to the start

Look at the stars
Look how they shine for you
And everything you do

I came along
I wrote a song for you
And all the things you do

So then I took my turn
Oh, what a thing to have done
And it was all yellow

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

[Chorus: Chris & Will, Chris]
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone

[Chorus]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
That's bursting into life

Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden
That's bursting into life

All that I am
All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes
They're all I can see
I don't know where
Confused about how as well
Just know that these things
Will never change for us at all

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?"

And all I can breathe is your life
And sooner or later, it's over

Or the moment of truth in your lies
When everything feels like the movies
Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive

Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
Hmm (Hey, hey)

[Verse 2]
Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love
Listen to the music of the moment, people dance and sing
We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved

[Chorus]
So I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm sure

[Post-Chorus]
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours

Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
A-soo da ba ba ba ba bum
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
Uh-huh, hmm

[Verse 3]
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

[Chorus]
But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours

[Verse 4]
Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
And look into your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)
There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)
'Cause our time is short (Is short, this)
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (Is our fate)

7,8,I Will Follow You Into The Dark,Death Cab for Cutie,0,Plans,2006-06-26,"[Verse 1]
Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind; I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark

[Chorus]
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""No""s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Verse 2]
In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, ""Son
Fear is the heart of love,"" so I never went back

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""No""s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Bridge]
You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down; the time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

And if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the ""No""s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks

8,9,How to Save a Life,The Fray,290,How to Save a Life,2005-09-13,"[Verse 1]
Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say ""sit down; it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

9,10,Love Will Tear Us Apart,Joy Division,0,Die Kalten Winde Des Winters,1980-06-01,"[Verse 1]
When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads

[Chorus]
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

[Verse 2]
Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

You cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed
And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold

Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Then love, love will tear it apart again
Love, love will tear it apart again"

Tap on my window, knock on my door

11,12,Such Great Heights,The Postal Service,262,Give Up,2003-01-01,"[Verse 1]
I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

[Verse 2]
And true, it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

[Chorus]
They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

[Verse 3]
I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat
It sounded thin upon listening

And that frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

[Chorus]
They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

Come on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here

Cut out all the ropes and let me fall

And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on, skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

And at the end of all your lines

Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?"

A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns

For girls in the 80s
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stare I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

I'm here without you, baby

And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah

And drowned her deep inside of me

Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise

Like a shoebox of photographs

Love is the answer
At least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?

Sometimes life can be deceiving

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too

Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together

So pretty when I sleep
And I wa...

And there is no
Combination of words I could say
But I will still
Tell you one thing

Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name

But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]

They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-nooo!""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown

I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before

And I’d probably be happy”

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

[Chorus]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Then why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Chorus]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself…

[Bridge: will.i.am]
Where is the love?

I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe, that the pictures are all I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you
Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you
Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go

[Verse 3]
Remembering you
Fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you
How you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything

I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart

But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart

Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat

I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

[Verse 2]
And true, it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows and when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

[Chorus]
They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

[Verse 3]
I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine but the persistent beat it
Sounded thin upon listenin'

And that frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows with the windows down
And this is guiding you home

[Chorus]
They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay"

One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by yours
I've kissed your lips and held your hand
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take

I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

And span the length of the Isle of Manhattan

Making a lake of the East River and Hudson

If I could open my mouth
Wide enough for a marching band to march out

And bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings

I wish we could open our eyes
To see in all directions at the same time
Oh what a beautiful view
If you were never aware of what was around you

And it is true what you said
That I live like a hermit in my own head
But when the sun shines again
I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in

Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound

It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown

They say it fades if you let it
Love was made to forget it
I carved your name across my eyelids
You pray for rain, I pray for blindness

[Chorus 1]
If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love has fallen from me
If you still want me, please forgive me
Because the spark is not within me

[Post-Chorus]
I snuffed it out before my mom walked
In my bedroom

[Verse 2]
The only thing that you keep changing
Is your name, my love keeps growing
Still the same, just like a cancer
And you won't give me a straight answer

[Chorus 2]
If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love has fallen from me
If you still want me, please forgive me
Because your hands are not upon me

[Post-Chorus]
I shrugged them off before my mom walked
In my bedroom

The pains of love, and they keep growing
In my heart there's flowers growing
On the grave of our old love
Since you gave me a straight answer

If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is not upon me
If you still want me, please forgive me

'Cause the spark is not within me
It's not within me

I'd sell my shoes

[Hook]
To be alone with you

You gave your body to the lonely

You gave up a wife and a family

They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
It's like a bad day that never ends
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life that I can't control

[Verse 1]
They say love ain't nothing but a sore
I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named
There's a part of my world that's fading away
You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please, tell me please

[Chorus]
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

[Verse 2]
Hang on to the good days
I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
But I'm feeding the enemy
I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
I can't try, I can't try, I can't try, I can't try
No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost now I think that I pay the cost
Now I've watched all my castles fall
They were made of dust, after all
Someday all this mess will make me laugh
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait

[Chorus]
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

[Bridge]
It's like somebody took my place
I ain't even playing my own game
The rules have changed well I didn't know
There are things in my life I can't control
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There's a part of my life that will go away
Dark is the night, cold is the ground
In the circular solitude of my heart
As one who strives a hill to climb
I am sure I'll come through I don't know how
They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please, tell me please

[Chorus]
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better

And start new when your heart is an empty room
With walls of the deepest blue

Home's face
How it ages when you're away
And spring blooms and you find a love that's true
But you don't know what now to do
Cause the chase is all you know and she stopped running months ago

And all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And out on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone

The flames and smoke climbed out of every window
And disappeared with everything that you held dear
But you shed not a single tear
For the things that you didn't need
Cause you knew you were finally free

Cause all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And out on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone

And all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And there on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone"

[Verse 1]
My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

[Refrain]
Swimming pool, glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coins

[Chorus 1]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

[Verse 2]
My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone

[Refrain]
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont, slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me
Gimme them coins

Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town

I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

[Chorus 2]
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

[Bridge]
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""

[Chorus 3]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down and now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

You are my one true love"

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing... I said nothing can take away these blues

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me?
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags
You said ""See, look, that's yours
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another's
Even in their plastic little covers?""

That secret that you know
But don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good girl
Because it's running you with red

Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both of my hands
Chewing on a candy bar
You said ""Ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this?""
As a moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss

And I said I know it well
That secret that we know
That we don't know how to tell

I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs, babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?

Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?

Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way

And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes

Some are dead and some are living

There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning

Making islands where no island should go

Have been silenced forevermore

It seems farther than ever before

""Y'all go ahead, I think I'm gonna kick it with my girl today"" (Kick it with my girl today)

Til I met this pretty little missile that shot me out the sky (Oh, shot me out the sky)

But I know it feels so damn good
Said if I could go back and make it happen faster
Don't you know I would, baby, if I could?
Miss Independent, to the fullest (Oh)
The load never too much, she helping me pull it
She shot the bullet that ended that life (Oh)
I swear to you the pimp in me just died tonight
Girl, sometimes love...

And it knocks you down (Hey, yeah)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Ooh, when it knocks you down) (Hey)
Sometimes love comes around (Ooh, whoa, yeah, comes around)

Tell me now, can you make it past your Caspers?
So we can finally fly off into NASA
You was always the cheerleader of my dream
That seem to only date the head of football teams
And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average?
For advice, OMG, you listen to that, bitch
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying, now I'm crashing
This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him

So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
(Whoa, whoa) Mmh
I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call
(Whoa, whoa)
And if it hits better, make it worth the fall, until it comes around, hey

Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around) (Comes around, whoa)
And it knocks you down

Sometimes love comes around (When love comes around) (When love comes around)

169,170,What Sarah Said,Death Cab for Cutie,380,Plans,2005-08-30,"And it came to me then that every plan
Is a tiny prayer to father time
As I stared at my shoes in the ICU
That reeked of piss and 409
And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself
That I'd already taken too much today
As each descending peak on the LCD
Took you a little farther away from me
Away from me

Amongst the vending machines and year-old​ magazines
In a place where we only say goodbye
It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend
On a faulty camera in our minds
And I knew that you were truth I would rather lose
Than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground
As the TV entertained itself

'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous paces bracing for bad news
And then the nurse comes round and everyone lifts their head
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said:
That love is watching someone die

So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?"

So sick and tired of all the needless beating

Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up while you can, whoa, whoa, whoa

Cause I'm not who I used to be
No longer easy on the eyes but these wrinkles masterfully disguise
The youthful boy below
Who turned your way and saw something he was not looking for
Both a beginning and an end
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize when he catches his reflection on accident

On the back of a motorbike with your arms outstretched trying to take flight, leaving everything behind
But even at our swiftest speed we couldn't break from the concrete
In the city where we still reside
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
For the sea like navy men
Cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed
Like brothers on a hotel bed

I touch the place
Where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases
Of distant dark places

I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science
Their words, mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground
And I, I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

After I have traveled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weeping
A joy you can't keep in

It was some time in early September
Though you were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind

So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on it
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon

Well I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all is over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
Let's Rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are

We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at

Well all these times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind, we're locked in time
But you're still mine
Do you remember?"

Two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
The only girl I've ever loved
Was born with roses in her eyes
But then they buried her alive
One evening, 1945
With just her sister at her side
And only weeks before the guns
All came and rained on everyone
Now she's a little boy in Spain
Playing pianos filled with flames
On empty rings around the sun
All sing to say my dream has come

[Chorus]
But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

[Verse 2]
And now we ride the circus wheel
With your dark brother wrapped in white
Says it was good to be alive
But now he rides a comet's flame
And won't be coming back again
The Earth looks better from a star
That's right above from where you are
He didn't mean to make you cry
With sparks that ring and bullets fly
On empty rings around your heart
The world just screams and falls apart

[Chorus]
But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

[Verse 3]
And here's where your mother sleeps
And here is the room where your brothers were born
Indentions in the sheets
Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
And it's so sad to see the world agree
That they'd rather see their faces filled with flies
All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes"

Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)

Give you all his hours

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go

I was foolish, I was lying to myself
I couldn’t have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn’t know you, 'cause I didn’t know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

Or have your touch and kiss your lips ‘cause I don’t have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn’t give to have you lying by my side
Right here, ’cause baby

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together

Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better

Singing to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)

So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, cryin' tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please

Holding me close until our eyes meet

And formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade

Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

I'd be around the morning after

It's always been wait and see
A happy day and then you pay
And feel like shit the morning after
But now I feel changed around and instead of falling down
I'm standing up the morning after

Situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later
And I could be another fool or an exception to the rule
You tell me the morning after

Crooked spin can't come to rest
I'm damaged bad at best
She'll decide what she wants
I'll probably be the last to know
No one says until it shows, see how it is
They want you or they don't
Say yes

Like I'm a little untrusting when I think that the truth is
Gonna hurt ya
And I don't know why you couldn't just stay with me
You couldn't stand to be near me
When my face don't seem to want to shine
'Cause it's a little bit dirty, well

Don't just stand there, say nice things to me
'Cause I've been cheated I've been wronged, and you
You don't know me, well I can't change
I won't do anything at all

There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there

But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there

And this walk that we shared together
The streets were wet, and the gate was locked
So I jumped it and I let you in
And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist
And you kissed me like you meant it
And I knew that you meant it
That you meant it, that you meant it
And I knew that you meant it

If you need directions

Something in your smile was so exciting

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Skipping beats, blushing cheeks, I am struggling
Daydreaming, bed scenes in the corner café
And then I'm left in bits recovering tectonic tremblings

Must you make me laugh so much?

Follow you home, you've got your headphones on and you're dancing
I've got a lucky beautiful shot, you're taking everything off, watch the curtains wide open
And you fall in the same routine flicking through the TV, relaxed and reclining
And you think you're alone...

It's always say goodnight and go

At my convenience
We'd be good, we'd be great together

Tried to reach deep but you couldn't get in

And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back

By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight

Can we both say the words and forget this?

And in my dreams I've kissed your lips a thousand times
I sometimes see you pass outside my door

Hello, is it me you're looking for?
I can see it in your eyes
I can see it in your smile
You're all I've ever wanted
And my arms are open wide
'Cause you know just what to say
And you know just what to do
And I want to tell you so much
I love you

I long to see the sunlight in your hair
And tell you time and time again how much I care
Sometimes I feel my heart will overflow

Hello, I've just got to let you know

And I wonder what you do
Are you somewhere feeling lonely?
Or is someone loving you?
Tell me how to win your heart
For I haven't got a clue
But let me start by saying
I love you

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you ready, but you don't really know
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

After all that, this is what I found
Nobody wants to be alone

Then maybe...

When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad

Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad

When you say that you love them and you really know
Everything that used to matter don't matter no more
Like my money, all my cars (you can have it all back)
Flowers, cards and candy (I do it just cause I'm)
Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
I want you to know I really adore you
All my people who know what's going on
Look at your mate, help me sing my song
Tell her: ""I'm your man, you're my girl
I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world""
Ladies say: ""I'm your girl, you're my man
Promise to love you the best I can""

When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back

I think that you should let it burn

This feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money
But boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where
We both could live

So excuse me forgetting
But these things I do
See I've forgotten if
They're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is
What I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen

Now that it's done

Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love
Feel unready for my love"

Looking out the door I see the rain
Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind
So you never know

Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child
You know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run

Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one
So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh, will I ever learn?

Oh lover, you should've come over
Cause it's not too late

Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns
For a sleep that will never come
It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Well maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong

[Chorus]
Oh... Ohh... Ohhhhh... Ohhhhhh...
Ohh..... lover, you should've come over
Yes, yes, I feel too young to hold on
And I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done

At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
Cause a bottle of Vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need...

For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is

That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night

Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby blind love is true

Know I'll be thinking about you

For it's you that I'd die to defend

Love hurts, love scars, love wounds
And marks, any heart
Not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, ooh, ooh love hurts

I'm young, I know, but Even so
I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, ooh, ooh love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not foolin' me

I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true
Love is just a lie
Made to make you blue
Love hurts, ooh, ooh love hurts

I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love?

Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love?

Life is Aisha

Without you who conceived the one

When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The waking up is the hardest part
You roll out of bed and down on your knees
And for a moment, you can hardly breathe
Wondering, “Was she really here?
Is she standing in my room?”
No she’s not
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

When you’re dreaming with a broken heart
The giving up is the hardest part
She takes you in, with her crying eyes
Then, all at once, you have to say goodbye
Wondering, “could you stay my love?
Will you wake up by my side?”
No she can’t
‘Cause she’s gone, gone, gone, gone, gone

Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
Oh, things are gonna happen naturally
Oh, taking your advice and I'm looking on the bright side
And balancing the whole thing
Oh, but often times those words get tangled up in lines

If nothing else, I'll think the bells inside
Have finally found you someone else and that's okay
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang

So there was this woman and
She was, uh, on an airplane and
She's flying to meet her fiancé
Sailing high above the, the largest ocean
On planet earth and she was seated
Next to this man who, you know
She had tried to start conversations
And only, really the only thing
She'd heard him say was to order his bloody mary
And she's sitting there and she's reading
This really arduous magazine article about a
Third world country that she couldn't
Even pronounce the-the name of and
She's feeling very bored and very despondent
And then uh, suddenly there's this huge mechanical failure and one of the engines gave out
And they started just falling, thirty thousand feet
And the pilot's on the microphone and he's, he's saying
""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Oh My God, I'm Sorry""
And apologizing and, and she looks at the man and she says, she says, she says
""Where are we going?"" and he looks at her and he says
""We're going to a party, it, it's a birthday party
It's your birthday party, happy birthday darling
We love you very, very, very, very, very, very, very much.""
And then, uh, he starts humming this little tune and, and uh, it kind of goes like this, it's kind of
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
We must talk in every telephone, get eaten off the web
We must rip out all the epilogues from the books that we have read
Into the face of every criminal strapped firmly to a chair
We must stare, we must stare, we must stare

We must take all of the medicines too expensive now to sell
Set fire to the preacher who is promising us Hell
Into the ear of every anarchist that sleeps but doesn't dream
We must sing, we must sing, we must sing
(And it'll go like this, all right...)

[Hook]
While my mother waters plants, my father loads his gun
He says
""Death will give us back to God
Just like the setting sun
Is returned to the lonesome ocean""
And then they splashed into the deep blue sea!
And it was a wonderful splash!

[Verse 2]
We must blend into the choir, sing as static with the whole
We must memorize nine numbers and deny we have a soul
And in this endless race for property and privilege to be won
We must run, we must run, we must run

We must hang up in the belfry where the bats and moonlight laugh
We must stare into a crystal ball and only see the past
Into the caverns of tomorrow with just our flashlights and our love
We must plunge, we must plunge, we must plunge
(And when we'll get down there, way down to the very bottom of everything
And then we'll see it, we'll see it, we'll see it)

Oh, my morning's coming back
The whole world's waking up
All the city buses swimming past

I found out I am really no one"

Well, I was there on the day they sold the cause for the queen
And when the lights all went out, we watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself, but it started with an alright scene
It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
It was a lie when they smiled and said, ""You won't feel a thing""
And as we ran from the cops we laughed so hard, it would sting

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, whoa, if I'm so wrong (So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter after I'm gone?

About a life-long wait for a hospital stay

So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV

Sometimes I find myself sitting back and reminiscing
Especially when I have to watch other people kissing
And I remember when you started calling me your missus
All the play fighting, all the flirtatious disses
I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you, but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt

[Pre-Chorus]
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame, but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
That the things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend
So come on, tell me
Is this the end?

[Verse 2]
Drinking tea in bed, watching DVD's
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
And you could tell I was nervous, so you held my hand
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
There's no one in the world who could replace you

Dreams of me and you

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king

In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

428,429,Name,Goo Goo Dolls,272,A Boy Named Goo,1995-09-26,"And even though the moment passed me by
I still can't turn away
With all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Tossed along the way
Letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away

And now we're grown-up orphans
That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame
You could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

Scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are?

You grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

I won't tell 'em your name
I won't tell 'em your name

I think about you all the time
But I don't need the same
It's lonely where you are
Come back down
And I won't tell 'em your name"

Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause baby, baby, you're my world

When a man loves a woman..."

Oh, I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet, I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show

I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl

Any strength to even try
To find a voice to speak your mind

Hiding your face in your hands
Talking 'bout far-away lands

I've been down so low
People look at me and they know
They can tell something is wrong
Like I don't belong
Staring through a window
Standing outside, they're just too happy to care tonight
I want to be like them
But I'll mess it up again
I tripped on my way in
And got kicked outside, everybody saw...

[Chorus]
And I know that it's a wonderful world
But I can't feel it right now
Well I thought that I was doing well
But I just want to cry now
Well I know that it's a wonderful world
From the sky down to the sea
But I can only see it when you're here, here with me

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I feel so full of love
It just comes spilling out
It's uncomfortable to see
I give it away so easily
But if I had someone I would do anything
I'd never, never, ever let you feel alone
I won't I won't leave you, on your own
But who am I to dream?
Dreams are for fools, they let you down...

And I wish that I could make it better
I'd give anything for you to call me, or maybe just a little letter
Oh, we could start again

C'mon and get a piece of this late-night lover
You know, the one that swing dick like no other
I know, I got a lot of things I need to explain
But, baby, you know the name, and love is about pain
So, stop the complaints and drop the order restraints
Our sex life's a game, so back me down in the paint
Cause I can't wait no more
Cause it's about a quarter past three and shorty's eyeing me
I got the Bentley valeted
And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 1]
I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely

It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you

If I could reach the stars
Pull one down for you
Shine it on my heart

That this love I have inside
Is everything it seems
But for now I find
It's only in my dreams

You would think my love was really something good
Baby if I could change the world

Even for a day
I'd take you as my queen
I'd have it no other way

And our love would rule
In this kingdom we have made
'Til then I'd be a fool
Wishing for the day

No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of Spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday, within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

Brushed off my Airs, even cut my hair for it
Cause normally I don't care for it
Don't even be looking for light like that, then there go it
Yeah, right over there, so I prepared to pour it
Little scared, my stare lowered, momma said have no fear
Plus I'm already out of my chair
Gather up my Airs on my square from here forward

But I think I like her like a metaphor—it's hard to get
In the car we sit, from the intro
She rolled down the window, just in case I was a schizo
I compliment her on the common sense
I'm calm, a little more confident
Uh huh, and then we lose consciousness
She says that I've been waiting for you
And I know you've been chasing me too, since they kidnapped
Me from a castle, I've been thinking of you
I told a fire-breathing dragon he better not harm me
Or be sorry when he meets my one man army
And thou has come to rescue me
My knight in shining armor, yes, you be
Woken up by the horn of an SUV
I said, ""See? Too beautiful to let you sleep
You're my sunshine""

It's kinda heavy, maybe a little strong
Gonna take much more than once
Can't trust what each of us say at least for a month
Or two, before I bid you adieu
Do this one thing for me: out of the trillions
Of numbers that's in the world just leave me a few
That lead to you
Won't be long then, I'll see you in the morning

Conversation got boring

And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in, with me

Put your arm around my shoulder
And it was if the room got colder
And we moved closer in together
And started talking about the weather
You said tomorrow would be fun
And we could watch 'A Place in the Sun'
I didn't know where this was going
When you kissed me

Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time
Watching telly, drinking wine
Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone
I no longer feel alone, no longer feel alone

I haven't left you for days now
And I'm becoming amazed how
You're quite affectionate in public
In fact your friend said it made her feel sick
And even though it's moving forward
There's just the right amount of awkward
And today you accidentally called me ""Baby""

Are you mine? Are you mine?

Pale and mild
A modern girl
Taken with thought, still prone to care
Making tea
In your underwear

You went out in the yard to find
Something to eat and clear your mind
Something bad inside me went away

Quaking leaves and broken light
Shifting skin
The coming night
The bearers of all good things arrive
Climb inside us
Twist and cry

A kiss on your molten eyes
Myriad lives like blades of grass
Yet to be realized - bow as they pass

They are cold
Still
Waiting in the ether to
Form
Feel
Kill
Propagate
Only to die

They are cold

Waiting in the ether to

Propagate

Leave
Dissipate coldly

Somebody
Told me that this planet was small, we used to live in
The same building, on the same floor, and never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour, and peeped this Ethiopian
Queen from Philly taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo, flash, focus, record
Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris at Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like, ""That shit don't matter."" When I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Telling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot
Starting building with her constantly round-the-clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep telling me…

And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some old…  another lonely night
Seem like I'm on the side, you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper, daddy, keep that shit tight
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politicking with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty—psych
I'm playin', boo, you know it's just with you I'm staying, boo
And when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweating on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listening to your homies, they be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you saying, I can trust you? Is you crazy?! You my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt

That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering, ""She trying to play you for the fool, Black.""
If something's on your chest, then let it be known
See, I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some ""Oh, I'm a celebrity!""
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to their squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where their whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like…

Let the rain fall, I don't care
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine
Suddenly, you're mine

And it's brighter than the sun
It's brighter than the sun
It's brighter than the sun, sunshine

[Verse 3]
Love will remain a mystery
But give me your hand, and you will see
Your heart is keeping time with me

[Chorus]
What a feeling in my soul
Love burns brighter than sunshine
It's brighter than sunshine
Let the rain fall, I don't care
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine
Suddenly, you're mine

Got a feeling in my soul
Love burns brighter than sunshine
It's brighter than sunshine
Let the rain fall, I don't care
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine
Suddenly, you're mine

I got a feeling in my soul
Love burns brighter than sunshine
It's brighter than sunshine
Let the rain fall, I don't care
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine
Suddenly, you're mine
And it's brighter than sunshine"

And the first time you touched me, I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love
Mmm, yeah

Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday

We're still together, still going strong

And you can't get in
I will show you
You're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone
And you can't get back again
I will find you
Darling and I will bring you home
And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time, you'll be fine

Down the corner of my street
Every night there, the headlights are glowing
There's a cold war coming
On the radio, I heard
Baby, it's a violent world

Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?
I can hear it coming
I can hear the siren sound
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Time came a-creeping
Oh and time's a loaded gun
Every road is a ray of light
It goes o-o-o-o-o-o-on
Time only can lead you on, still it's
Such a beautiful night

Oh, love, don't let me go
Won't you take me where the street lights glow?

2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, winter just wasn't my season""
Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

[Verse 2]
May he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
""Just a day,"" he said down to the flask in his fist
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year
Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while
But my god, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, boys
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

[Bridge]
There's a light at each end of this tunnel
You shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you made, you'll just make them again
If you only try turning around

[Breakdown]
2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me
Threatening the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them, however you want to

[Chorus]
But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
Wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins

I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
I'm out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you

Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room
Got me hypnotised, I'm getting high on the perfume
I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain

I'm addicted to you, hooked on your love
Like a powerful drug I can't get enough of
Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
Out of control, what can I do?

And the darkness is a clear view
Because you've come to rescue me

Right where yours fit perfectly
I'll find repose in new ways
Though I haven't slept in two days

This vacation's useless, these white pills aren't kind
I've given a lot of thought on this thirteen hour drive
I missed the grinding concrete where we sat past 8 or 9
And slowly finished laughing in the glow of our headlights
I've given a lot of thought to the nights we used to have
The days have come and gone, our lives went by so fast
I faintly remember breathing on your bedroom floor
Where I laid and told you, but you swear you loved me more

Will you sleep tonight? Will you think of me?
Will I shake this off, pretend it's all okay?

There is

We don't see eye to eye
Or hear ear to ear

Don't you wish that we could forget that kiss
And see this for what it is
That we're not in love

The saddest part of a broken heart
Isn't the ending so much as the start

It was hard to tell just how I felt
To not recognize myself
I started to fade (away, away, away)

And after all it won't take long to fall (in love)
Now I know what I don't want
I learned that with you

Losing your mind for the sake of your heart

I was staring at the sky, just looking for a star
To pray on, or wish on, or something like that
I was having a sweet fix of a daydream of a boy
Whose reality I knew, was a hopeless to be had
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope
And I believed for a moment that my chances
Were approaching to be grabbed
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag

[Chorus]
Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up
I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold
Hunger hurts, but starving works, when it costs too much to love

[Verse 2]
And I went crazy again today
Looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope
Baby said he couldn't stay
Wouldn't put his lips to mine and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
I said, ""Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified
Come on put a little love here in my void,""
He said ""It's all in your head,""
And I said, ""So's everything"" but he didn't get it
I thought he was a man but he was just a little boy

I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind

Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

I am heaven sent
Don't you dare forget
I am all you've ever wanted
What all the other boys all promised
Sorry I told
I just needed you to know

I think in decimals and dollars
I am the cause to all your problems
Shelter from cold
We are never alone

Coordinate brain and mouth
Then ask me what it's like to have myself so figured out
I wish I knew

I hope this song starts a craze
The kinda song that ignites the airwaves
The kinda song that makes people glad to be where they are
With whoever they're there with

This is war
Every line is about who I don't wanna write about anymore
Hope you come down with something they can't diagnose
Don't have the cure for

Holding on to your grudge
Oh, it's so hard to have someone to love
And keeping quiet is hard
'Cause you can't keep a secret
If it never was a secret to start
At least pretend you didn't wanna get caught

We were contenders, we're throwing the fight
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
In us

Oh, we're so c-c-c-c-c-controversial

[Verse 3]
We are entirely smooth
We admit to the truth
We are the best at what we do

And these are the words you wish you wrote down
This is the way you wish your voice sounds
Handsome and smart
Oh, my tongue's the only muscle on my body
That works harder than my heart

And it's all from watching TV
And from speeding up my breathing
Wouldn't stop if I could
Oh, it hurts to be this good

You're holding on to your grudge
Oh, it hurts to always have to be
Honest with the one that you love
Oh, so let it go

We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe

We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
I just wanna believe
In us

This is the grace only we can bestow
This is the price you pay for loss of control
This is the break in the bend
This is the closest of calls
This is the reason you're alone
This is the rise and the fall!

We're concentrating on falling apart
We were contenders, we're throwing the fight

See you right back here tomorrow, for the next round
Keep this scene inside your head
As the bruises turn to yellow and the swelling goes down

And if you're ever around in the city or the suburbs of this town
Be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in sorrow, wearing a frown, like Pierrot the clown

Saw you crashing 'round the bay
Never seen you act so shallow or look so brown
Remembered all the things you'd say
How your promises went hollow, as you threw me to the ground

And if you're ever around in the backstreets or the alleys of this town
Be sure to come around
I'll be wallowing in pity, wearing a frown, like Pierrot the clown

[Chorus 1]
Hi-yeah, I got plenty of time
Hi-yeah, you got light in your eyes
And you're standing here beside me
I love the passing of time
Never for money, always for love
Cover up and say goodnight, say goodnight

[Verse 2]
Home is where I want to be
But I guess I'm already there
I come home, she lifted up her wings
I guess that this must be the place
I can't tell one from the other
Did I find you or you find me?
There was a time before we were born
If someone asks, this is where I'll be, where I'll be

[Chorus 2]
Hi-yeah, we drift in and out
Hi-yeah, sing into my mouth
Out of all those kinds of people
You got a face with a view
I'm just an animal looking for a home and
Share the same space for a minute or two
And you love me 'til my heart stops
Love me 'til I'm dead
Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
Cover up the blank spots, hit me on the head, ah-ooh"

I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

I've got an angel
She doesn't wear any wings
She wears a heart that can melt my own
She wears a smile that can make me want to sing

She gives me presents
With her presence alone
She gives me everything I could wish for
She gives me kisses on the lips just for coming home

She could make angels
I've seen it with my own eyes
You've got to be careful when you've got good love
Because the angels will just keep on multiplying

But you're so busy changing the world
Just one smile can change all of mine

The first time that I saw
Your head 'round the door

There was wet in your hair
I was stood in the stairs
And time stopped moving

I want you here tonight, I want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
Want you here tonight, want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down

I remember it well:
Taxied out of a storm
To watch you perform
And my ships were sailing

I remember it well:
I was stood in your line
And your mouth, your mouth, your mouth

I want you here tonight, want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
Want you here tonight, want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down

Except you my love
'Cept you my love

Dive into moss
And hope that my sanity covers the cost
To remove the stain of my love
Paper maché

Come, all ye reborn
Blow off my horn

But I
I whip myself with scorn, scorn

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in

Fifteen

And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning

Ain't no nigga that she holding

Look at all that money

Just take my hand
Hold it tight

I will protect you
From all around you

Keep you safe and warm

Can't be broken
I will be here
Don't you cry

They just don't trust what they can't explain
I know we're different, but deep inside us
We're not that different at all

When destiny calls you, you must be strong
I may not be with you
But you've got to hold on
They'll see in time, I know
We'll show them together

[Chorus]
Cause you'll be in my heart
Believe me, you'll be in my heart
I'll be there from this day on

You'll be here in my heart (I'll be there)

Goodbye to sleep
I think that staying up is exactly what I need
Well take apart your head
Take apart the counting
And the flock it has bred
Goodbye to love
It’s just a ride that will push you up
Right against the wall (Does everybody really need to know everyone?)
Take apart your head
Do you really think you’re really a part of it?
Right against the wall
And is your army really one of some thousands?
Chew it up and swallow it
And will you declare war on the loony bin?

I've been sleeping on the incline
I can't shake this little feeling
I'll never get anything right

A memory of the cushion life I'm clinging to
The image of a mutual one, our haven
The sombre chords of our song, the fading

Love is no big truth
Driven by our genes, we are simple selfish beings
A symphony that's you
Joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping

Passion and its brother hate, they come and go
It could easily be made to stay for longer though
Many people play this game so willingly
Do I have to be like them, or be lonely?

Love is no big truth
Driven by our genes, we are simple selfish beings
A symphony that's you
Joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping

Another view
Of what there is to it
Getting me through it

I'll never need it again, not again, not again (8x)"

It would fall down while I'm asleep

[Pre-Chorus]
If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, baby

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Verse 3]
But we have not hit the ground
Doesn't mean we're not still falling, oh
I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame
I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
But until then, the fact remains

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
Nothing last forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

[Chorus]
Everyday
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing last forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way"

New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning

I've gotta big big big heart beat, yeah!
I think you are the sweetest thing
I wear a coat of feelings and they are loud
I've been having good days
Think we are the right age to start our own peculiar ways?
With good friendly homes

You get me freaked freaked freaked on Preakness
I've never met a girl that
Likes to drink with horses
Knows her Chinese ballet
I must admit you smell like fruity nuts and good grains
When you show my purple gaze a thing or two at night

It'd make me sick sick sick to kiss you and I think that I would vomit
But I'll do that on Mondays
I don't have to work away
I like it when I bump you
An accident's a truth gate
I'm humbled in your pretty lens
I'll hold you don't you go

Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet
(Hallelujah!)
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know

Well I'd like to spread your perfume around the old apartment
Could we live together and agree on the same wares
A trapeze is a bird cage and even if its empty it definitely fits the room
And we would too

And my dear dear dear Khalana
I talk too much about you
Their ears are getting tired of me singing all the night through
Lets just talk together
You and me and me and you
And if there's nothing much to say
Well, silence is a bore

[Intro]

Sometimes you're quiet and sometimes I'm quiet
(Hallelujah!)
Sometimes I'm talkative and sometimes you're not talkative, I know
Sometimes you hear me when others they can't hear me
(Hallelujah!)
Sometimes I'm naked and thank god sometimes you're naked. Well, hello...

Can I tell you that you are the purple in me?
Can I call you just to hear you would you care?
When I saw you put your purple finger on me
There's a feeling in your bottle
Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part [x2]

Gotta crush high
Thought I crushed all I could
Crushed all I can then I touched your hand
Crush high
Don't want it to stop
Cause stories of your brother make my crush high bop
And you couldn't really know cause its in my toes
And sometimes I wonder where'd that crush high go
Crush high
Then I go and take some pills
Cause I can't do all of my do's and still feel ill
You get that WOOOO! [x2]"

To cast divine arrows into her soul
To grab her attention swift and quick
Or morrow the marrow of her bones be thick
With turpentine kisses and mistaken blows

He loves none sweeter as sweeter the dare

Her heart the captive of which he speaks
So note all ye lovers in love with the sound
Your world be shattered with nary a note
Of one Cupid's arrow under your coat

And barren hearted wanderers
Forever lost in forsaken missives and Satan's pull

[Verse 1]
Holy cow, I think I've got one here
Now just what am I supposed to do?
I've got a number of irrational fears
That I'd like to share with you
First, there's rules about old goats like me
Hanging 'round with chicks like you
But I do like you and another one:
You say 'like' too much

[Chorus]
But I'm shaking at your touch, I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
I'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you, oh

[Verse 2]
Holy moly, baby, wouldn't you know it?
Just as I was busting loose
I gotta go turn in my rock star card
And get fat and old with you
'Cause I'm a burning candle, you're a gentle moth
Teaching me to lick a little bit kinder
And I do like you - you're the lucky one
No, I'm the lucky one

[Chorus]
I'm shaking at your touch, I like you way too much
My baby, I'm afraid I'm falling for you
I'd do 'bout anything to get the hell out alive
Or maybe I would rather settle down with you

Holy sweet goddamn
You left your cello in the basement
I admired the glowing stars
And tried to play a tune
I can't believe how bad I suck, it's true
What could you possibly see in little ol' three chord me?
But I do like you and you like me too
I'm ready, let's do it, baby

Drinking champagne from a paper cup
Is never quite the same
And every sip's moving through my eyes

As I'm waiting around for you

Since I've memorized your face
It's been four hours now
Since I've wandered through your place
And when I sleep on your couch
I feel very safe
And when you bring the blankets
I cover up my face

I do
Love you
I do
Love you

And when you play guitar
I listen to the strings buzz
The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet
I feel mesmerized and proud

And I would say I love you
But saying it out loud is hard
So I won't say it at all
And I won't stay very long

But you are the life I needed all along
I think of you as my brother
Although that sounds dumb

And words are futile devices"

It's already coming in

Unless you were fed it

Past the places where you used to learn
You howl and listen
Listen and wait for the
Echoes of angels who won't return

To put you together
You're waiting for someone to push you away

There's always something more you wish he'd say

He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time

And watch it unwind
It's only what you're asking for
And you'll be just fine
With all of your time
It's only what you're waiting for

Out of the island
Into the highway
Past the places where you might have turned
You never did notice
But you still hide away
The anger of angels who won't return

He's everything you want
He's everything you need
He's everything inside of you
That you wish you could be
He says all the right things
At exactly the right time
But he means nothing to you

I am everything you want
I am everything you need
I am everything inside of you
That you wish you could be

I asked somebody 'Could you send my letter away'?
'You are too young to put all of your hopes in just one envelope'
I said goodbye to someone that I love
It's not just me, I tell you it's the both of us
And it was hard
Like coming off the pills that you take to stay happy

Someone above has seen me do alright
Someone above is looking with a tender eye
Upon your face, you may think you're alone but you may think again

If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang about and be there with my best friend
If she wants me

And far away somebody read the letter
He condescends to read the words I wrote about him
And if he smiles, it's no more than a genius deserves
For all your curious nerve and your passion

I'm going deaf, you're growing melancholy
Things fall apart, I don't know why we bother at all
But life is good and 'It's always worth living at least for a while'

If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes

Then take the baton, girl, you better run with it
'Cause there is no point in standing in the past cause it's over and done

I took a book and went into the forest
I climbed the hill, I wanted to look down on you
But all I saw was twenty miles of wilderness so I went home

They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes

For the wheels to nullify

Until this turn in my head

I spent twelve long months on the lam

That's enough sitting on the fence
For the fear of breaking dams

In the logic of love
And go out of my head

You love a sinking stone
That'll never elope
So get used to the lonesome
Girl, you must atone some
Don't leave me no phone number there

It took me all of a year
To put the poison pill to your ear
But now I stand on honest ground, on honest ground

You want to fight for this love
But honey you cannot wrestle a dove
So baby it's clear

You want to jump and dance
But you sat on your hands
And lost your only chance

Go back to your hometown
Get your feet on the ground
And stop floating around

I find a fatal flaw

And go out of my head

Where everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Is try to take it back before it all went wrong

[Chorus]
Before the worst, before we mend
Before our hearts decide it's time to love again
Before too late, before too long
Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong

[Verse 2]
There was a time when we stayed up all night
Best friends, yeah, talking till the daylight
We took the joys alongside the pain
With not much to lose but so much to gain
Are you hearing me? 'Cause I don't wanna miss
Set you adrift on a memory bliss
It was Grafton Street on a rainy night
I was down on one knee and you were mine for life

[Pre-Chorus]
We were thinking we would never be apart
With your name tattooed across my heart
Oh, who would ever thought we would end up like this?
Where everything we talked about is gone
And the only chance we have of moving on
Is try to take it back before it all went wrong

[Chorus]
Before the worst, before we mend
Before our hearts decide it's time to love again
Before too late, before too long
Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong

[Bridge]
If the clouds don't clear
We'll rise above it
We'll rise above it (whoa)
Heaven's gate is so near
Come walk with me through
Just like we used to
Just like we used to

Yeah
Yeah

Let's take it back before it all went wrong

[Chorus]
Before the worst (before)
Before we mend (before)
Before our hearts decide it's time to love again
Before too late
Before too long
Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong (all wrong)

Let's try to take it back before it all went wrong"

You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
You stood in my doorway with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

[Pre-Chorus]
Well in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees

[Chorus]
These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

[Verse 2]
You're always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art
Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must've got
Off track with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Excuse me
Think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself

These foolish games are tearing me, you're tearing me
You're tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

There is no greater thrill
Than what you bring to me
No sweeter song
Than what you sing, sing to me

And to think that you are mine alone (you are mine alone)
There is no greater love
In all the world, it's true
No greater love
Than what I feel for you"

774,775,2 Atoms In A Molecule,Noah and the Whale,124,"Peaceful, The World Lays Me Down",2008-08-11,"Last night I had a dream we were inseparably entwined
Like a piece of rope made out of two pieces of vine
Held together, holding each other with no one else in mind
Like 2 atoms in a molecule inseparably combined

But then I woke from the dream to realise I was alone
A tragic event I must admit but let's not be overblown
I'm not trying to write a love song just a sad, pathetic moan
Maybe I just need a change, maybe I just need a new cologne

Now I look at love like being stabbed in the heart
You torture each other from day to day and then one day you part
Most of the time it's misery but there's some joy at the start
Oh for that I'd say it's worth it, just use a blade that's short and sharp on me

And if love is just a game then how come it's no fun
If love is just a game how come I've never won
I guess maybe it's possible I might be playing it wrong
And that's why every time I roll the dice I always come undone"

I had a beer and now I hear you callin' out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

Well, the room is crowded—people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well, if you sit down with this old clown, I'll take that frown and break it
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we can make it
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

[Verse 3]
Well, the night does funny things inside a man
These old tomcat feelings you don't understand
Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

[Verse 4]
I can see that you are lonesome just like me
And it being late, you'd like some company
Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
The guy you're with, he's up and split—the chair next to you is free
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me

[Verse 5]
Now, it's closing time
The music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
Well, I turn around to look at you—you're nowhere to be found
I search the place for your lost face—guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you"

Walking down by the bay, on the shore
Staring up at the stars that aren't there anymore
I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
So like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound
To my motion fatigue, farewell, with your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves in underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

And they wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep
So I can hardly relax or even oversleep
But I feel warm with your hand in mine
When we walk along the shoreline
I guess we'll never know why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow

[Interlude: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
Yeah all the time
All the time

[Chorus: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time

[Bridge: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

[Outro: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
Time together is just never quite enough
When we're apart what ever are you thinking of?
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
So tell me darling do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time
Oh, all the time"

Keep on clapping
Just remember I'll be by your side

Than to see your face when you open the door

And in the afternoon, then maybe we'll talk
I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV

And you say that all that it takes is a phone call

And danced on tables
Hotels, trains and ships that sail
We swim with sharks
And fly with aeroplanes in the air

Send in the trumpets
The marching wheelchairs
Open the blankets and give them some air
Swords and arches, bones and cement
The light and the dark of the innocence of men

We know your house so very well
And we will wake you once we've walked up all of your stairs

There's nothing like living in a bottle
And nothing like ending it all for the world
We're so glad you have come back
Every living lion will lay in your lap

The kid has a homecoming! The champion, the whores!
Who's gonna play drums, guitar or organ with chorus
As far as we've walked from both of ends of sand
Never have we caught a glimpse of this man

We know your house so very well
And we will bust down your door if you're not there

We've lived in bars
And danced on tables
Hotels, trains and ships that sail
We swim with sharks
And fly with aeroplanes out of here

Out of here
Out of here
Out of here

You've got the best of both worlds
You're the kind of girl who can take down a man
And lift him back up again
You are strong but you're needy
Humble but you're greedy
And based on your body language
And shoddy cursive I've been reading
Your style is quite selective
Though your mind is rather reckless
Well I guess it just suggests
That this is just what happiness is

[Chorus]
Hey, what a beautiful mess this is
It's like picking up trash in dresses

[Verse 2]
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
Kind of turn themselves into knives
And don't mind my nerve you could call it fiction
But I like being submerged in your contradictions, dear
Cause here we are, here we are

[Verse 3]
Although you are biased I love your advice
Your comebacks ‒ they're quick
And probably have to do with your insecurities
There's no shame in being crazy
Depending on how you take these
Words i'm paraphrasing this relationship we're staging

[Chorus]
Hey, what a beautiful mess this is
It's like picking up trash in dresses

[Verse 4]
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
And ""kind and courteous"" is a life I've heard
But it's nice to say that we played in the dirt
Cause here, here we are, here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are

We're still here
What a beautiful mess this is
It's like taking a guess when the only answer is ""Yes""

Through timeless words and priceless pictures
We'll fly like birds not of this earth

And tides ‒ they turn ‒ and hearts disfigure
But that's no concern when we're wounded together

And we tore our dresses and stained our shirts
But it's nice today. Oh, the wait was so worth it"

That means another day without you my friend
And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself
And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else

And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away

So many people to love in my life
Why do I worry about one
But you put the happy in my ness
You put the good times into my fun

And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door

We've tried the goodbyes
So many days
We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray
They say if you love somebody
Then you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery

They say that time, will make all this go away
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is a droppin on down
And once again you my friend are no where to be found

And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
You just walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Just walk on
Walk on
Turn and head for the door
Walk away"

The one you left when you broke into my house
I'm retracing every step you made

Second of every single day

Look back at boat feet and that winding knee

Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world’s a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home

How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
Cos we've shared the laughter and the pain and even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now, oh there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Ooh take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what I've got to face
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now, well there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now, cos there's just an empty space
But to wait for you, is all I can do and that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now, cos I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
It's the chance I've gotta take
Take a look at me now"

Da-da, da-da
Yo, I can't sing, but
I feel like singing
I wanna fuckin' sing
‘Cause I'm happy
Yeah, I'm happy
I got my baby back
Yo, check it out

[Verse 1]
Some days I sit starin' out the window
Watchin' this world pass me by
Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for
I almost break down and cry
Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy
Why am I here? Am I just wastin' my time?
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

[Chorus 1]
‘Cause sometimes (Fuck) it feels like (I was scared) the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 2]
My baby girl keeps gettin' older
I watch her grow up with pride
People make jokes ‘cause they don't understand me
They just don't see my real side
I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy
My insecurities could eat me alive
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no

[Chorus 1]
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over
But then she comes back to me

[Verse 3]
Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin' as long as my father
To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't *reh tnaw*
Now, you probably get this picture from my public persona
That I'm a pistol-packin' drug addict who bags on his momma
But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
‘Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted, and—

[Chorus 2]
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

[Outro]
Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh, well—I tried
Hailie, 'member when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess what—Daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby
I love you (​​*smooch*)​​"

After a day I got perfectly right

They say in heaven

Love me, wherever you are

How do you turn what the savage tame?

To love you, again and again

You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place
I'm not lost, no no, just undiscovered
I'm not running, oh, I'm not hiding
If you dig a little deeper you will find me
I'm not lost, not lost, undiscovered
When we're alone we're all the same as each other
We're always the same
You see the look that's on my face, you might think that I'm out of place

What's wrong baby?
Don't they treat you like they should?
Did you take them for it?
For every penny that you could?
We once walked out on the beach and once I almost touched your hand
Oh how I dreamed to finally say such things
Then only to pretend

[Verse 2]
Don't you know I'm thinking (know I'm thinking)
Driving 405 past midnight
You know I miss you (don't you know that I miss you?)
Ninth and Ash on a Tuesday night
I would write to you from Museum Mile
A toast to you: your whisper, your smile
Up the stairs at Weatherford
A ghost each place I hide

[Chorus]
If you don't, don't know, why would you say so?
Would you mean this please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight
If you don't know, honey, why'd you just say so?
'Cause I need this now more than I ever did
If you don't well, honey, then you don't

[Verse 3]
I left you waiting (I know I left you waiting)
At the least could we be friends?
Should have never started (never started)
Ain't that the way it always ends?
On my life I'll try today
There's so much I've felt I should say but
Even if your heart would listen
I doubt I could explain

If you don't don't know, why'd you say so?
Would you mean this please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight?

So here we are now
A sip of wine a sip of water
Someday maybe
Maybe someday we'll be smarter
And I'm sorry that I'm such a mess
I drank all my money could get and
Took everything you let me have
And then I never loved you back

If you don't don't know, why would you say so?
Would you mean the please if it happens?
If you don't know, why would you say so?
Won't you get your story straight?

836,837,Song for Zula,Phosphorescent,369,Muchacho,2013-01-15,"Some say love is a burning thing, that it makes a fiery ring
Oh but I know love as a fading thing
Just fickle as a feather in a stream
See honey, I saw love, you see it came to me
It put its face up to my face so I could see
Yeah, then I saw love disfigure me
Into something I am not recognizing

You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’
I will not open myself up this way again
I lay my face to the soil, and all my teeth to the sand
I will not lay like this for days now upon end
You will not see me fall, or see me struggle to stand
To be acknowledged by some touch from his gnarled hand
You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’
I will not open myself up this way again

You see the moon is bright in that treetop night
I see the shadows that we cast in the cold clean light
Now my feet are gold, and my heart is white
And we race out on the desert plains all night
See honey, I am not some broken thing
I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee
No my heart is gold and my feet are light
And I am racing out on the desert plains all night

Some say love is a burning thing, that it makes a fiery ring
Oh but I know love as a caging thing
Just a killer, come to call from some awful dream
Ah and all you folks, you come to see
You just stand there in the glass looking at me
But my heart is wild and my bones are steam
And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free"

Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

[Verse]
Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire
The way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would, if they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing
Something else that hides away
From me and you, there are worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh, I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I'll throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round yesterday
I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do
Elise, believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke and make-believe ran out

So, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

Like falling sand
As fast as I pick it up
It runs away through my clutching hands

Stopped to take it in

And the love can begin
It might start now, yeah
Well, maybe I’m just dreaming out loud
Until then

From the bruise of a floor of this prison

Taken broken up to the mountain

[Verse 2: Louis & Harry & Harry and Louis & Harry and Niall]
You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
Maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

[Chorus: Harry and Niall & Harry]
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right darling but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh

[Chorus: Harry & All]
And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things
I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you they add up to
I'm in love with you, and all your little things"

I'll get inside you
I'll get inside you

[Verse 1: Adema]

Don't live with shame
'Cause feelings change
And fame remains
The reason why
You're gonna wanna take me home tonight
It's all the same
Up in this game
The people change
And money claims
Everyone from everything
I can't believe
That you would think that shit of me
I was amazed at the torment that you put me through
If you could see right through the greed
And all your needs
You'd realize that you're just about as bad as me

[Chorus]
Sometimes I only remember
The days when I was young
Nowadays no one remembers when they were young and stupid
The way you like it
Come on baby help me
Someone to confide in
I'll get inside you
Now you're begging me to stay

[Verse 2]
My life has changed
But fuck the fame
I'll stay the same
You can't complain when you can pay the bills and do your thing
Appreciate
Don't playa hate
Congratulate
I miss the pain and the torment that you put me through
(I'll get inside you)
So what's to fear
When everything is crystal clear
You realize you that should do the things you wanna do
Don't give into
What people say
Don't be ashamed
To separate the feelings on your mind you can't sedate
(The way you like it)

[Chorus]
Sometimes I only remember
The days when I was young
Nowadays no one remembers when they were young and stupid
The way you like it
Come on baby help me
Someone to confide in
I'll get inside you
Now you're begging me to stay

[Bridge]
I'll get inside you
Now you're begging me to stay
I'll get inside you
You would always say I'd never be shit
They would always say I'd never be shit
Well, look at me now! Look at me now!
Now you're begging me to stay
I'll get inside you
Now you're begging me to stay
The way you like it

Sometimes I only remember
The days when I was young
Nowadays no one remembers when they were young and stupid
The way you like it
Come on baby help me

Sometimes I only remember
The days when I was young

Nowadays no one remembers when they were young and stupid

Come on baby help me, someone to confide in
I'll get inside you

Now you're begging me to stay
I'll get inside you

Ah, the moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep
Ah but a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
And I'd fall at your feet
And I'd howl at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please (Please)
I'm your man

And if you've got to sleep
A moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if you want to work the street alone

Or only want to walk with me a while
Across the sand

In one single moment your whole life can turn around
I stand there for a minute, staring straight into the ground
Looking to the left slightly, then looking back down
The world feels like it's caved in proper, sorry frown
Please let me show you how we could only just be for us
I can change and I can grow, or we could adjust
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
We can even have an open relationship if you must
I look at her, she stares almost straight back at me
But her eyes glaze over like she's looking straight through me
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
When they open up, she's looking down at her feet

[Chorus]
Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

[Verse 2]
So then I move my hand up from down by my side
Shaking, my life is crashing before my eyes
I turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies
Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh
'Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me
There's things I can't imagine doing, things I can't imagine seeing
It weren't suppose to be easy, surely
Please, please, I beg you, please
She brings her hand up towards where my hands rested
She wraps her fingers 'round mine with the softness she's blessed with
She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures
By pushing my hand away to my chest, from hers

[Chorus]
Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

[Interlude]
And I'm just standing there
I can't say a word, 'cause everything's just gone
I've got nothing, absolutely nothing

[Verse 3]
Trying to pull her close out of bare desperation
Put my arms around her, trying to change what she's saying
Pull my head level with hers, so she might engage and
Look into her eyes to make her listen again
I'm not gonna fucking just fucking leave it all now
'Cause you said it'd be forever and that was your vow
And you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall down?
You're well out of order now, this is well out of town
She pulls away my arms that tightly clamp around her waist
Gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face
Takes one step forward, looks back, and then walks away

[Chorus]
Dry your eyes, mate
I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up
There's plenty more fish in the sea
Dry your eyes, mate
I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts
But you've got to walk away now, it's over

I know in the past I've found it hard to say
Telling you things but not telling straight
But the more I pull on your hand and say
The more you pull away

There's plenty more fish in the sea

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible

In burning red

Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met

Comes back to me, burning red

878,879,Bowl of Oranges,Bright Eyes,0,"Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground",2002-08-13,"The rain, it started tapping on the window near my bed
There was a loophole in my dreaming so I got out of it
And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open
Just my nightstand and my dresser where those nightmares had just been
So I dressed myself and left then, out into the gray streets
But everything seemed different and completely new to me
The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body
And each person I encountered, I couldn't wait to meet
And I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health
I said, ""There's nothing I can do for you you can't do for yourself""
He said, ""Oh yes you can, just hold my hand, I think that that would help""
So I sat with him a while, then I asked him how he felt

He said, ""I think I'm cured
In fact, I'm sure of it
Thank you, stranger
For your therapeutic smile""

So that's how I learned the lesson that everyone's alone
And your eyes must do some raining if you're ever going to grow
But when crying don't help, you can't compose yourself
It's best to compose a poem
An honest verse of longing or a simple song of hope
That is why I'm singing, baby don't worry, cause now I got your back
And every time you feel like crying I'm gonna try and make you laugh
And if I can't, if it just hurts too bad, then we'll wait for it to pass
And I will keep you company through those days so long and black
And we'll keep working on the problem we know we'll never solve
Of love's uneven remainders, our lives are fractions of a whole
But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall
Then I think we'd see the beauty, then we'd stand staring in awe

At our still lives posed
Like a bowl of oranges
Like a story told
By the fault lines and the soil"

About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind

Where I went wrong

889,890,The Start of Something,Voxtrot,271,Raised by Wolves,2005-07-25,"This time of night I could call you up
I get angry with athletic ease
Break common laws in twos and threes
If I die clutching your photograph
Don't call me boring, it's just cause I like you

Oh, take me on back, take me on back, and take me back
To the place where I could feel your heart
Is this the end or just the start
Of something really, really beautiful
Wrapped up and disguised as
Something really really ugly?

Won't you...

Come by and see me, I'm a love-letter away
I'd break your name before I'd say:
""I really love you, love you,""
No, I don't care if you saw
I watched every inch of film flash across your Roman features
And I loved it, loved it

No, I don't care if...

You think I'm eager to shut your eyes
Well, I'm sorry everybody knows
You can't break me with your gutter prose
Would you believe it? She sent me a letter
The ring, it nearly weighs her down
She's got another boy, oh boy

Steady your ears, steady your ears and read my lips
Poetry is not a luxury, it's how I break this home
And when I'm really ill, won't you cradle me?
Man is not a noble animal, but maybe woman is

Remember, I heard you...

Inside your room you said:
You'd never really live until your back's against the wall
Oh did you really mean it?
No, I never break my gaze, if just to see the scar
Remain reflected in your eyes
I think it's time to go home

Oh, tell me your thoughts
Tell me your thoughts on liberty
See there's a place where I sink to sleeping
She said:
""Oh, my vote is as red as my blood,""
Will you join me for another round?
I haven't had the chance to speak yet

Godspeed...

I break the law once every week to feel your touch
Oh, what's a book to you in bed?
Do you feel better? Older?
Say this just makes me ill
Your name is dripping from my pen
Still, you're not around to curse
I've gotta drop the gun now
Say I'm still under you


Marianne, let the ghosts sleep tonight
Marianne, let the ghosts sleep
Just shut your eyes and burn the past
Marianne, let the ghosts sleep tonight
Marianne, let the ghosts sleep
Just shut your eyes and burn the past

Just shut your eyes and burn the past

And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for

Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself, ""hold on to your heart""
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for

I have been a fool for lesser things
I want you so bad

Untouched by work or duty

For underground metaphors
You can scrape an inch below the turf, for what it's worth
My style's been developed in the core of the Earth
The exhale's volcanic, the inhale is seismic
So brothers just panic when the Live one arrives with
The natural ability to run through your crew
From 2-1-4 to 2-1-3 to 2-1-2
In other words, from Dallas, to L.A., to the place where J stay
Everyday is mayday
So you can talk your shit on how you're wettin MC's
With mad blood stains but I'll bet you can't stand the rain
I'm lookin' on your brain with disdain
Go back and reflect on my endeavors black I can't complain
It's like a raw deal, consistant with the way I make you feel
The ends stay revealed but the means I conceal
And those who try to steal get decapitated
You wanna snatch my H2O type flow, but it evaporated
I displays my credentials over instrumentals
And my potential, increases at a rate that's exponential
It's detremental fuckin' with my thesis
The penetration's exact, like amniocentesis
I rip your shit to pieces after drainin out your fluid
My vocab is fluent yours is evident of being truant
I know you wanna make moves but son you best to take a second look
Before my knight takes your rook

So why the hell they tryin to deal with Live I don't know
I handle true MC's on their block or at their show

That leaves the competition running scared and shakin in their pants
You best to set it off cause black it ain't no second chance
Once I'm open, all you doin is hopin that the Live one
Will put the mic down, but son don't try to snatch it after
The laughter won't cease from the comparison, how dare you son
Step around the booth when I'm on
The microphone magician says poof, you're gone with the wind -
(Background: ""The Best Part, is brought to you by the letters: J, L, I, V, and E"")
- There's no trace of your friends cause you don't know where the
Beginning ends or where the end begins
But you see that's the difference, you get sold, I get paid
Black I told you, get played
If you're broke I'll have to rain on your parade
You belong in Special Ed if you think you got it made
J-Live with the mic is like the chef with the blade
Cause suckers get sliced and sauteed
Yeah, you thought your shit was fly but the flight was delayed
Because

[Hook: repeat 2x]

[J-Live]
Cause yo, I take the grey matter of pretenders
Through my mental blender, and then return to sender
My pen don't pretend to offend
I intend to render MC's, hangin loose like a fender bender
I recommend regardless of your gender
That you strike fuckin' with J-Live from your agenda
And remember that whoever lends a helpin hand to defend ya
Will get burned to a cinder
As I end the, reign of wack MC's with their suicidal tendencies
Renderin me sick, with the thoughts of killin enemies
But then I return to reality
Metaphorically murderin MC's when they battle me
You can't rattle me
I'm not your average snake slitherin through the grass
I surpass the serpent as I head to class
You consider me crass as I wax that ass, style's no joke
But you best belive I gets the last laugh"
941,942,Why,Annie Lennox,303,Diva,1992-04-06,"How many times do I have to try to tell you
That I'm sorry for the things I've done
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
""Hey… this kind of trouble's only just begun""
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth, falling from your mouth
Tell me…
Why?

I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off
Besides…
Why can't you see this boat is sinking
(This boat is sinking, this boat is sinking)
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out, turning inside out

Tell me
Why?

Tell me
Why?

This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tears…
The tears we shed
This is the fear
This is the dread
These are the contents of my head
And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
‘Cause I don't think you know how I feel, how I feel"

I am not worried, I am not overly concerned
My friend implores me, ""For one time only
Make an exception"" I am not worried

Wrap her up in a package of lies
Send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried
I am not overly concerned

With the status of my emotions
Oh, she says, ""You're changing""
But we're always changing
It does not bother me to say

This isn't love
'Cause if you don't wanna talk about it
Then it isn't love
And I guess, I'm gonna have to live without

But I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray
Or something in between
And I can always change my name
If that's what you mean

My friend assures me, ""It's all or nothing""
But I am not really worried
I am not overly concerned

You try to tell yourself the things, you try tell yourself
To make yourself forget, to make yourself forget
I am not worried

""If it's love,"" She said
""Then we've gonna have to think about the consequences""
Cause she can't stop shaking
And I can't stop touching her

And this time, when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away
And Anna begins to change her mind

""These seconds when I'm shaking
Leave me shuddering for days,"" She says
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

But I'm not gonna break
And I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
I'm not gonna bend and I'm not gonna break
Gonna worry about it anymore
No, no, no, no, no

It seems like I should say
""As long as this is love""
But it's not all that easy, so maybe I should

Snap her up in a butterfly net
And pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried
'Cause you've done this sort of thing before

But then I start to think about the consequences
'Cause I don't get no sleep in a quiet room

And this time, when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away
And Anna begins to change my mind

Every time she sneezes, I believe it's love
And oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake
And Anna begins to toss and turn

And every word is nonsense, but I understand
And oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along
And Anna begins to fade away

It's chasing me away, she disappears
And oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing"

If they try to pull you out
Would you even go?

I held your hand until the light
The scars were on the back

Get you through the idea of the luck

Could I even know?

What the heart wants (Wants, wants, wants)

You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up

But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants

[Verse 2]
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape

The bed's getting cold and you're not here

No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breathless moments
Breaking me down, down, down, down

The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call

We sent out the S.O.S. call
It was a quarter past four in the morning
When the storm broke our second anchor line
Four months at sea
Four months of calm seas
To be pounded in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point

They call 'em rogues, they travel fast and alone
One hundred foot faces of God's good ocean gone wrong
What they call love is a risk
Cause you will always get hit
Out of nowhere by some wave
And end up on your own

[Chorus 1]
The hole in the hull defied the crew’s attempts
To bail us out
And flooded the engines and radio
And half-buried bow

[Verse 2]
Your tongue is a rudder
It steers the whole ship
Sends your words past your lips
Keeps them safe behind your teeth
But the wrong words will strand you
Come off course while you sleep
Sweep your boat out to sea
Or dashed to bits on the reef

The vessel groans
The ocean pressures its frame
To the port I see the lighthouse
Through the sleet and the rain
And I wish for one more day to give my
Love and repay debts
But the morning finds our bodies washed up 30 miles west

[Chorus 2]
They say that the captain stays fast with the ship
Through still and storm
But this ain't the Dakota
And the water's cold (so cold)
Won't have to fight for long

[Outro]
(This is the end)
This story's old but it goes on and on
Until we disappear
(This is the calm)
Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed
While you were underneath

(We are the risen)
I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains
Sunk below the sea
(After the storm)
I spoke the words but never gave a thought
To what they all could mean

(Rest in the deep)
I know that this is what you want
A funeral keeps both of us apart
(Washed up on the beach)
You know that you are not alone
I need you like water in my lungs

(This is the end)
This story's old but it goes on and on
Until we disappear
(This is the calm)
Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed
While you were underneath

(We are the risen)
I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains
Sunk below the sea
(After the storm)
I spoke the words but never gave a thought
To what they all could mean

I know that this is what you want
A funeral keeps both of us apart

You know that you are not alone

All I needed for another day

Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I need you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more

In a house on the street where you live?
Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike
Would I know?

And in a wide sea of eyes
I see one pair that I recognize
And I know that I am
I am, I am the luckiest

And love is a crying baby

And the thorn bush in your path
That burns a scented oil
That I'll drip into your bath
The water's there to warm you
And the earth is warmer

Sucking on your breath mint, dissected and stuck with pins

Concrete and water, she's looking for her daughter
At midnight in torrential downpour
And everything I said about how messed up your head is
Got cut up and left in bits and pieces on the cutting room floor

Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve

Take the picture from the wall when you think that nothing matters
Take the picture from the frame and it's a long ways to the floor
Cut your finger on the edge cause it's sharper than they told you
Take a leap from out the window cause it's way too far to go through the door

964,965,Sometime Around Midnight,The Airborne Toxic Event,324,The Airborne Toxic Event,2008-08-05,"And it starts sometime around midnight
Or at least that's when you lose yourself for a minute or two
As you stand under the bar lights
And the band plays some song
About forgetting yourself for a while
And the piano's this melancholy soundtrack to her smile
And that white dress she's wearing
You haven't seen her for a while

But you know that she's watching
She's laughing, she's turning
She's holding her tonic like a crux
The room's suddenly spinning
She walks up and asks how you are
So you can smell her perfume
You can see her lying naked in your arms

And so there's a change in your emotions
And all these memories come rushing
Like feral waves to your mind
Of the curl of your bodies like two perfect circles entwined
And you feel hopeless and homeless
And lost in the haze of the wine

Then she leaves with someone you don't know
But she makes sure you saw her
She looks right at you and bolts
As she walks out the door
Your blood boiling, your stomach in ropes
Oh, and your friends say ""What is it?
You look like you've seen a ghost""

Then you walk under the streetlights
And you're too drunk to notice that everyone's staring at you
You just don't care what you look like
The world is falling around you

You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You know that she'll break you in two"

I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking, ""This is where rednecks come from""
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions, and I was the man for the job

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Verse 2]
I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat, and thought, you fool, it could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Bridge]
Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me?
Or am I really seeing what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams coming back to me

[Chorus]
She went way up yonder past the caution light
Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

Thank God for good directions, and turnip greens"

First tell me which road you will take
I don't want to risk our paths crossing some day
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way

And the future hangs over our heads
And it moves with each current event
Until it falls all around
Like a cold steady rain
Just stay in when it's looking this way

And the moon's laying low in the sky
Forcing everything metal to shine
And the sidewalk holds diamonds
Like the jewelry store case
They argue walk this way, no, walk this way

And Laura's asleep in my bed
As I'm leaving she wakes up and says
""I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
Baby don't go away, come here""

And there's kids playing guns in the street
And one's pointing his tree branch at me
So I put my hands up
I say ""Enough is enough
If you walk away, I'll walk away""
And he shot me dead

I found a liquid cure
From my landlocked blues
It'll pass away like a slow parade
It's leaving but I don't know how soon

And the world's got me dizzy again
You'd think after 22 years I'd be used to the spin
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
So I'm always pacing around or walking away
I keep drinking the ink from my pen
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase:
""If you love something, give it away""

A good woman will pick you apart
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
But you may be offended and you may be afraid
But don't walk away, don't walk away

We made love on the living room floor
With the noise in the background of a televised war
And in the deafening pleasure
I thought I heard someone say
""If we walk away, they'll walk away""

But greed is a bottomless pit
And our freedom's a joke
We're just taking a piss
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
If you're still free start running away
Cause we're coming for you!

I've grown tired of holding this pose
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
Saying, ""Let me walk away, please""
You'll be free, child, once you have died
From the shackles of language and measurable time
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Till then walk away, walk away

So I'm up at dawn
Putting on my shoes
I just want to make a clean escape
I'm leaving but I don't know where to
I know I'm leaving but I don't know where to"

Forceless it pulls you to your chair
Hides you away from these half days
Sunless, at the end of the year

The air is like a knife cutting through you
A room in the house is always warm
Stretched down on the bathroom floor thinking
Of fair days your future may hold

Love comes like surprise ice on the water
Love comes like surprise ice at dawn
Love comes like surprise ice on the water
Love comes at dawn

Deprived all the light of colours
The world ends at your window tree
Darkness creates these illusions
That pale days can teach you to see

Rain falls but no life is given
Weeks pass, no progress is made
Past sometimes takes you with soft hands
And all that surrounds you will fade

Love comes like surprise ice at dawn
Love comes like surprise ice on the water

I was made for you

I climbed across the mountaintops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
But baby I broke them all for you

Oh because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do
I was made for you

You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my head is a mess

No they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what I've been through
Like you do, and I was made for you

All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am

And take my passport out again

See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way

And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I’ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"

And the day feels broken
I tilt my head
I'm trying to get an angle

I've always longed for
It could still happen

Seven phone calls

It might just happen
Anyway

And the day feels a-broken
Just lean into the crack

And it will tremble
Ever so nicely
Notice how it sparkles
Down there

What I give
But it's not up to me

Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away, I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go, I come back to the place you are

All my instincts, they return
And the grand façade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride

In your eyes I am complete
In your eyes I see the doorway
In your eyes to a thousand churches
In your eyes the resolution
In your eyes of all the fruitless searches

In your eyes Oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes, the light, the heat

I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes

Then break my dreams the way you do?
How can I have got in so deep?
Why did I fall in love with you?

Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen
This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known

And now I know that there's a link between the two
Being close to craziness and being close to you

How can you make me fall apart
Then break my fall with loving lies?
It's so easy to break a heart
It's so easy to close your eyes
How can you treat me like a child
Yet like a child I yearn for you?

How can anyone feel so blue?

And the nights when the living room was on the lawn
Constant quarreling, the childish fits
And our clothes in a pile on the ottoman
All the slander and double-speak
Were only foolish attempts to show you did not mean
Anything but the blatant proof
Was your lips touching mine in the photobooth

And as the summer's ending
The cool air will push your hard heart away
You were so condescending
And this is all that's left
Scraping paper to document
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on

Cup your mouth to compress the sound
Skinny dipping with the kids from a nearby town
And everything that I said was true
As the flashes blinded us in the photobooth
Well, I lost track, and then those words were said
You took the wheel and you steered us into my bed
And soon we woke and I walked you home
And it was pretty clear that it was hardly love

And as the summer's ending
The cool air will rush your hard heart away
You were so condescending
And this is all that's left
Scraping paper to document
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on

And as the summer's ending
The cool air will rush your hard heart away
You were so condescending
As the alcohol drained the days

And as the summer’s ending
The cool air will rush you hard heart away
You were so condescending
And this is all that’s left
The empty bottles, spent cigarettes
So pack a change of clothes cause it’s time to move on"

It's easier to tease
But you can't paint an elephant
Quite as good as she

And she may cry like a baby
And she may drive me crazy
Cause I am lately lonely

[Verse 2]
So why d'you have to lie?
I take it I'm your crutch
The pillow in your pillow case
Is easier to touch

And when you think you've sinned
Do you fall upon your knees?
And do you sit within your picture?
Do you still forget the breeze?

[Chorus 2]
And she may rise, if I sing you down
And she may wisely cling to the ground
Cause I'm lately horny
So why would she take me horny?

[Bridge]
What's the point of this song? Or even singing?
You've already gone, why am I clinging?
Well I could throw it out, and I could live without
And I could do it all for you
I could be strong
Tell me if you want me to lie
Cause this has got to die

[Outro]
This has got to stop
This has got to lie down, down
With someone else on top

You can both keep me pinned
Cause it's easier to tease
But you can't make me happy

His mother cried, ""My child's tied his laces""
Why must we move on from such happy lawns
Into nostalgia's palm and feed on the traces

Do you hop to the dance or embarrass the parents?
Who should I please? I go to sleep worrying
That blood in the dark will attract the sharks
Who are not violent we all got hungry bellies

But where are the still unborn who could look at me with the one eye
Who could look at me with no eyes
Who could look at me with me in their eyes

What's pain? What's sadness anyway? It's not crying like a child

What's graying? What's aging anyway? It's not growing in the wild

I feel like I've just been born
When you look at me with your green eyes
When you look at me with your black eyes
When you look at me with your dead eyes

And I can't understand when holding her hand
So womanly, I have to go and kiss her

And what a surprise to look in those eyes
To find suddenly he is Jack, the Ripper
Too suddenly he was Jack, the Ripper

He stopped crying like a child
She stopped crying like a child

But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back paving the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together, I hope she frames it!
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losing everything that I came with
Feel like I've been here before, huh?
I still got ten years to go, huh?

[Refrain: Drake]
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is all right

Oh, I know, I know you don't love me, baby
They’re trying to take you away from me
Only over my dead body

In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side

Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far, like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight

Number nine with my head on the bar

I got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent
Bring you back to the bar, get you out of the cold
My sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
Who they'll kiss before they get home

I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say

Barely conscious in the door where you stand
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
And your hair smells of smoke
Who will cast the first stone?
You can sin or spend the night all alone

Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
If you let me have my way, I swear, I'll tear you apart

Cause it's all you can be
You're a drunk, and you're scared
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free

A corner bar, and it just seemed right
So I pulled up

Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: ""What'll it be?""

He didn't pour me a beer

Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much

Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that""

It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

He said ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

[Chorus 2]
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'

A magic trick makes the world disappear
The skies are dark, they're dark but they're clear

A distant motorcade and suddenly there's joy
The snow and tickertape blurs all my senses numb
It's like the finish line where everything just ends
The crack of radios seems close enough to touch

Cold water, cleaning my wounds
A side parade, with a single balloon
I'm done with this, I'm counting to ten
Blue as seas, running to them

I feel like I am watching everything from space
And in a minute I hear my name and I wake
I think the finish line's a good place we could start
Take a deep breath, take in all that you could want"

Drawing deep breaths past my door
And last night's phrases
Sick with lack of basis
Are still writhing on my floor

That your wicked words should work in holding me down

Given at close range
For the gag and the bind

Became dialogue
As a diagram of a play for blood

Now I can taste your agenda
While you're spitting your cud

Take all the things

Put 'em in a sack
Swing 'em over my shoulder
Turn on my heels, step out of his sight

All that you can give is a cold goodbye

With kitchen tools, usually, sometimes wire cutters. In answer to the obvious question, surviving patients most often report that their sexual urges had become a source of intolerable conflict and anxiety. The desire for perfect release and the real-world impossibility of perfect, whenever-you-want-it release had together produced a tension they could no longer stand.

It is to the 30+ testosteronically afflicted males whose cases have been documented in the past two years that your correspondents wish to dedicate this article. And to those tormented souls considering autocastration in 1998, we wish to say: “Stop! Stay your hand! Hold off with those kitchen utensils and/or wire cutters!” Because we believe we may have found an alternative.

Every spring, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents awards for outstanding achievement in all aspects of mainstream cinema. These are the Academy Awards. Mainstream cinema is a major industry in the United States, and so are the Academy Awards. The AAs’ notorious commercialism and hypocrisy disgust many of the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during prime time to watch the presentations. It is not a coincidence that the Oscars ceremony is held during TV’s Sweeps Week. We pretty much all tune in, despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it’s still an art form, of hearing people in $5,000 gowns invoke lush clichés of surprise and humility scripted by publicists, etc.—the whole cynical postmodern deal—but we all still seem to watch. To care. Even though the hypocrisy hurts, even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves, even though Cannes and Sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones. But the truth is that there’s no more real joy about it all anymore. Worse, there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there’s still joy. That we think it’s funny when Bob Dole does a Visa ad and Gorbachev shills for Pizza Hut. That the whole mainstream celebrity culture is rushing to cash in and all the while congratulating itself on pretending not to cash in. Underneath it all, though, we know the whole thing sucks.

Your correspondents humbly offer an alternative.

Every January, the least pretentious city in America hosts the Annual AVN Awards. The AVN stands for Adult Video News, which is sort of the Variety of the US porn industry. This thick, beautifully designed magazine costs $7.95 per issue, is about 80 percent ads, and is clearly targeted at adult-video retailers. Its circulation is appr. 40,000.

Though the sub-line vagaries of entertainment accounting are legendary, it is universally acknowledged that the US adult-film industry, at $3.5-4 billion in annual sales, rentals, cable charges, and video-masturbation-booth revenues, is an even larger and more efficient moneymaking machine than legitimate mainstream American cinema (the latter’s annual gross commonly estimated at $2-2.5 billion). The US adult industry is centered in LA’s San Fernando Valley, just over the mountains from Hollywood.1 Some insiders like to refer to the adult industry as Hollywood’s Evil Twin, others as the mainstream’s Big Red Son.

It is no accident that Adult Video News—a slick, expensive periodical whose articles are really more like infomercials—and its yearly Awards both came into being in 1982. The early ’80s, after all, saw the genesis of VCRs and home-video rentals, which have done for the adult industry pretty much what TV did for pro football.

From the 12/11/97 press release issued by AVN (visitable also at www.avn.com):

- The nominations for the 15th Annual AVN Awards were announced today.2 This year’s awards show, commemorating AVN’s 15th anniversary, celebrates “History”. [sic]

- Awards will be presented in a record 106 categories over a two night period.

- The adult industry released nearly 8,000 adult releases [sic] in 1997, including over 4,000 “new” releases (non-compilation). AVN reviewed every new release in every categroy [sic] this past year, logging over 30,000 sex scenes.3

- By comparison, last year there were approximately 375 films eligible for the Academy Awards that these voters [sic—meaning different voters from the AVN voters, presumably] were required to see. AVN had to watch more than 10 times the amount of releases in order to develop these nominations [usage and repetition sic, though 4,000 divided by 375 is indeed over 10].

From the acceptance speech of Mr. Tom Byron, Saturday, 10 January 1998, Caesars Forum ballroom, Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino complex, Las Vegas NV, upon winning AVN’s 1998 Male Performer of the Year Award (and with no little feeling): “I want to thank every beautiful woman I ever put my cock inside.” [Laughter, cheers, ovation.]

From the acceptance speech of Ms. Jeanna Fine, ibid., upon winning AVN’s 1998 Best Supporting Actress Award for her role in Rob Black’s Miscreants: “Jesus, which one is this for, Miscreants? Jesus, that’s another one where I read the script and said ‘Oh shit, I am going to go to hell. [Laughter, cheers.] But that’s okay, ’cause all my friends’ll be there too!” [Huge wave of laughter, cheers, applause.]

From the inter-Award banter of Mr. Bobby Slayton, professional comedian and master of ceremonies for the 1997 AVNAs: “I know I’m looking good, though, like younger, ’cause I started using this special Grecian Formula—every time I find a gray hair, I fuck my wife in the ass. [No laughter, scattered groans.] Fuck you. That’s a great joke. Fuck you.”

Bobby Slayton, a gravelly-voiced Dice Clay knockoff who kept introducing every female performer as “the woman I’m going to cut my dick off for,” and who astounded all the marginal print journalists in attendance with both his unfunniness and his resemblance to every apartment-complex coke dealer we’d ever met, is mercifully absent from the 1998 Awards gala. The ’98 emcee is one Robert Schimmel, alumnus of In Living Color and a Howard Stern regular. Schimmel looks like a depraved, deeply tan Wallace Shawn and is no less coarse than B. Slayton but a lot better. He does a pantomime of someone attempting intercourse with a Love Doll he’s been too lazy to blow up all the way. He contrasts the woeful paucity of his own ejaculate with the concussive orgasms of certain well-known male performers,4 comparing these men’s ejaculations to automatic lawn sprinklers and doing an eerie sonic impression of same. All of 1998’s marginal print journalists are together at Table 189 at the very back of the ballroom. Most of these reporters are from the sorts of men’s magazines that sit shrinkwrapped behind the cash registers of convenience stores, and they are a worldly and jaded crew indeed, but Schimmel gets a couple of them—whose noms de guerre are Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth—laughing so uproariously that people at the Anabolic Video table nearby keep looking over in annoyance. At one point during a routine on premature ejaculation, Dick Filth actually chokes on a California roll.

… But all this is Saturday night, the main event. And there are a whole lot of festivities preceding Saturday’s climax.

The adult industry is vulgar. Would anyone disagree? One of the AVN Awards’ categories is “Best Anal Themed Feature”; another is “Best Overall Marketing Campaign—Company Image.” Irresistible, a 1983 winner in several categories, has been spelled Irresistable in Adult Video News for fifteen straight years. The industry’s not only vulgar, it’s predictably vulgar. All the clichés are true. The typical porn producer really is the ugly little man with a bad toupee and a pinkie-ring the size of a Rolaids. The typical porn director really is the guy who uses the word class as a noun to mean refinement. The typical porn starlet really is the lady in Lycra eveningwear with tattoos all down her arms who’s both smoking and chewing gum while telling journalists how grateful she is to Wadcutter Productions Ltd. for footing her breast-enlargement bill. And meaning it. The whole AVN Awards weekend comprises what Mr. Dick Filth calls an Irony-Free Zone.

But of course we should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do w/ lewdness or bad taste. At root, vulgar just means popular on a mass scale. It is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby. It is humility with a comb-over. It is Nielsen ratings and Barnum’s axiom and the real bottom line. It is big, big business.

Thirty-four-year-old porn actor Cal Jammer killed himself in 1995. Starlets Shauna Grant, Nancy Kelly, Alex Jordan, and Savannah have all killed themselves in the last decade. Savannah and Jordan received AVN’s Best New Starlet awards in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Savannah killed herself after getting mildly disfigured in a car accident. Alex Jordan is famous for having addressed her suicide note to her pet bird. Crewman and performer Israel Gonzalez killed himself at a porn company warehouse in 1997.

An LA-based support group called PAW (=Protecting Adult Welfare) runs a 24-hour crisis line for people in the adult industry. A fundraiser for PAW was held at a Mission Hills CA bowling alley last November. It was a nude bowling tournament. Dozens of starlets agreed to take part. Two or three hundred adult-video fans showed up and paid to watch them bowl naked. No production companies or their executives participated or gave money. The fundraiser took in $6,000, which is slightly less than two one-millionths of porn’s yearly gross.

As you know if you’ve seen Casino, Showgirls, Bugsy, etc., there are really three Las Vegases. Binion’s, where the World Series of Poker is always played, exemplifies the “Old Vegas,” centered around Fremont Street. Las Vegas’s future is even now under late-stage construction at the very end of the Strip, on the outskirts of town (where US malls always go up); it’s to be a bunch of theme-parkish, more “family-oriented” venues of the kind that De Niro describes so plangently at the end of Casino.

But Las Vegas as most of us see it, Vegas qua Vegas, comprises the dozen or so hotels that flank the Strip’s middle. Vegas Populi: the opulent, intricate, garish, ecstatically decadent hotels, cathedra to gambling, partying, and live entertainment of the most microphone- swinging sort. The Sands. The Sahara. The Stardust. MGM Grand, Maxim. All within a small radius. Yearly utility expenditures on neon well into seven figures. Harrah’s, Casino Royale (with its big 24-hour Denny’s attached), Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace. The Mirage, with its huge laddered waterfall always lit up. Circus Circus. Treasure Island, with its intricate facade of decks and rigging and mizzens and vang. The Luxor, shaped like a ziggurat from Babylon of yore. Barbary Coast, whose sign out front says CASH YOUR PAYCHECK—WIN UP TO $25,000. These hotels are the Vegas we know. The land of Lola and Wayne. Of Siegfried and Roy, Copperfield. Showgirls in towering headdress. Sinatra’s sandbox. Most of them built in the ’50s and ’60s, the era of mob chic and entertainment-cum-industry. Half-hour lines for taxis. Smoking not just allowed but encouraged. Toupees and convention nametags and women in furs of all hue. A museum that features the World’s Biggest Coke Bottle. The Harley-Davidson Cafe, with its tympanum of huge protruding hawg; Bally’s H&C, with its row of phallic pillars all electrified and blinking in grand mal sync. A city that pretends to be nothing but what it is, an enormous machine of exchange—of spectacle for money, of sensation for money, of money for more money, of pleasure for whatever be tomorrow’s abstract cost.

Nor let us forget Vegas’s synecdoche and beating heart. It’s kittycorner from Bally’s: Caesars Palace. The granddaddy. As big as 20 Wal-Marts end to end. Real marble and fake marble, carpeting you can pass out on without contusion, 130,000 square feet of casino alone. Domed ceilings, clerestories, barrel vaults. In Caesars Palace is America conceived as a new kind of Rome: conqueror of its own people. An empire of Self. It’s breathtaking. The winter’s light rain makes all the neon bleed. The whole thing is almost too pretty to stand. There could be no site but Las Vegas’s Caesars for modern porn’s Awards show—here, the AAVNAs are one more spectacle. Way more tourists and conventioneers recognize the starlets than you’d expect. Double-takes all over the hotel. Even just standing around or putting coins in a slot machine, the performers become a prime attraction. Las Vegas doesn’t miss a trick.

The Annual AVN Awards are always scheduled to coincide with the International Consumer Electronics Show (a.k.a. CES), which this year runs from 8 through 11 January. The CES is a very big deal. It’s like a combination convention and talent show for the best and brightest in the world of consumer tech. Steve Forbes is here, and DSS’s Thomson. Sun Microsystems is using this year’s CES to launch its PersonalJava 1.0. Bill Gates gives a packed-house speech on Saturday morning. Major players from TV, cable, and merchandising host a panel on the short-term viability of HDTV. A forum on the problem of product returns by disgruntled customers seats 1,500 and is SRO. The CES as a whole is bigger than your correspondents’ hometowns. It’s spread out over four different hotels and has 10,000+ booths with everything from “The First Ever Full Text Message Pager in a Wristwatch” to the world’s premier self-heating home satellite dish (“The Snow and Ice Solution!”).

But far and away the CES’s most popular venue, with total attendance well over 100,000 every year, is what is called the Adult Software5 exhibition, despite the fact that the CES itself treats the Adult tradeshow kind of like the crazy relative in the family and keeps it way out in what used to be the parking garage of the Sands hotel. This facility, a serious bus ride from all the other CES sites, is an enormous windowless all-cement space that during show hours manages to induce both agoraphobia and claustrophobia. A big sign says you have to be 21 to get in. The median age inside is 45, almost all males, nearly everyone wearing some sort of conventioneer’s nametag. Every production company in the adult industry, from Anabolic to Zane, has a booth here. The really big companies have booths that are sprawling and multidisplay and more like small strip malls. A lot of porn’s top female performers are contract players, exclusive vendors to one particular production company; and one reason why a lot of the starlets seem kind of tired and cranky by Saturday night’s Awards gala is that they will have spent much of the previous 72 hours at their companies’ CES booths, on their feet all day in vertiginous heels, signing autographs and posing for pictures and pressing all manner of flesh.

The best way to describe the sonic environment at the ’98 CES is: Imagine that the apocalypse took the form of a cocktail party. Male fans move through the fractal maze of booths in groups of three or more. Their expressions tend to be those of junior-high boys at a peephole, an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline. Some among them are video retailers; most are not. Most are just hard-core fans, the industry’s breath and bread. A lot of them not only recognize but seem to know the names, stage names, and curricula vitae of almost all the female performers.

It takes an average of two hours and twelve minutes to traverse the Adult CES expo, counting an average of four delays for getting lost after a chicane turn or some baroque ceiling-high cheval glass designed to double the visual exposure of Heatwave Video’s display for Texas Dildo Masquerade gets you all turned around. Your correspondents are accompanied by Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, who have very generously offered to act as guides and docents, and here is a random spatter of the things we see the first time we come in:

A second-tier Arrow Video starlet in a G-string poses for a photo, forked dorsally over the knee of a morbidly obese cellphone retailer from suburban Philadelphia. The guy taking the picture, whose CES nametag says Hi and that his name is Sherm, addresses the starlet as “babe” and asks her to readjust so as to “give us a little more bush down there.” An Elegant Angel starlet with polyresin wings attached to her back is eating a Milky Way bar while she signs video boxes. Actor Steven St. Croix is standing near the Caballero Home Video booth, saying to no one in particular “Let me out of here, I can’t wait to get out of here.”6 Adult-video stores all have a distinctive smell—a mix of cheap magnetic tape and disinfectant—and the Sands’ former parking garage is rank with it. Asian businessmen move through the aisles in dense graceful packs and are assiduously cheery and polite. A young guy in a full-color Frankenstein T-shirt is spraypainting cartoon flames on an actress’s breasts at the Sin City booth. The actress—an obscure one, not even Filth and Hecuba know her name—has normal-size breasts, and there’s not much of an audience. Producer/director Max Hardcore draws a way bigger crowd at the MAXWORLD booth, where one of his girls is squatting on the countertop masturbating with the butt of a riding crop. Max’s videos’ promotional posters have him carrying a girl in minishorts over his shoulder against the backdrop of various city skylines; the pitches at the bottom say “SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL! SEE CUM-SPLATTERED GIRLS TOO STUPID TO KNOW BETTER!” Max is a story all to himself, according to Harold Hecuba. D. Filth and a porn executive dressed entirely in Campbell Nightwatch plaid are smoking cigars and keep holding their cigars up together and comparing the ash to see which one has the cleanest burn. A lot of the industry males and even some of the starlets are also smoking cigars. 1998 is definitely the Year of the Cigar. The starlets are all in either extremely formal cocktail dresses or else abbreviated latex/vinyl/ Lycra ensembles. Heels are uniformly sharp and ultrahigh. Some of the starlets are so heavily made up they look embalmed. They tend to have complexly coiffed hair that looks really good from 20 feet away but on closer inspection is dry and dead. Someone who is either sometime-performer Jeff Marton or “Bizarro-Sleaze” filmmaker Gregory Dark is doing sleight-of-hand tricks with his trademark fedora.7 Whoever he is, he has a goatee. Harold Hecuba also has a goatee; Dick Filth has more like a soul patch. H.H. and D.F., longtime industry journalists, know everybody here and keep getting stopped and drawn into conversations. (These delays, during which yr. corresps. sort of stand there awkwardly at the edge of the conversation and try to look around as if they too know people here and are waiting only to spot them in the crowd before they go off and get into their own involved conversations, have not been included in the 132-minute Adult CES-traversal average.) This year, a good 75 percent of the males in and around the porn industry appear to be sporting variants of the goatee.8

Next to the Outlaw Video booth, a starlet in a gold lamé spaghetti-strap gown, chewing gum and blowing large blue bubbles, is being videotaped by a disabled fan whose camera and parabolic mike are bolted to the arm of his wheelchair; the starlet is pointing to the tattoos on her left arm and appears to be explaining the origin and context of each one. At the Vivid Video multibooth complex,9 Ms. Taylor Hayes has what is probably the longest autograph-and-flesh-press line in the entire Sands garage. Taylor is major-league pretty—she looks like a slightly debauched Cindy Crawford—and an oversize monitor suspended from the ceiling over the Vivid area plays clips of her scantily clad and dancing amid dry-ice fumes. There’s a berm of boxed videos on the floor by the counter and a huge man with a visor and handheld credit card machine on Taylor’s right flank as she greets each fan like a long-lost relative. According to Dick Filth, Taylor is both a genuinely nice person and a consummate pro.

The booth for XPlor Media—a company known for its “Southern Belles” video series and ORGY FOR WORLD PEACE Website—is arresting because all the execs at XPlor seem to be under 25 and the booth’s atmosphere is that of a fraternity party in its third straight day. One young bald guy is unconscious in a fetal position on the counter, and some wag has glued all sorts of feathers and flaccid plastic two-headed dildoish things to his skull. XPlor’s owner-auteurs are two brothers, trust-fund babies from a Connecticut suburb of NYC. Their names are Farrel and Moffitt Timlake. Farrel, who wears twelve-hole Doc Martens and cargo pants and what’s either a very light parka or very heavy sweatshirt with a hood that stays up at all times, is a particular cause célèbre at the ’98 CES because he’s apparently a friend of the two guys who do South Park, and these guys are rumored to be in Vegas and to possess tickets to Saturday’s Awards banquet.10

Everyone without exception is sweating. At all but a few of the booths, contract starlets treat the fans with the same absent, rigid-faced courtesy that flight attendants and restaurant hostesses tend to use. You can tell how bored the performers are by the way their faces light up when they see someone they know. Well over half of the industry’s current superstars are in this huge room.11 The infamous T.T. Boy is here, standing alone with his trademark glower, the Boy who is rumored to bring a semiautomatic pistol with him to the set and who was featured in a 1995 New Yorker article that was full of lines like “A porn shoot is an intricately delineated ecology.” Mr. Vince Vouyer (sic) is on hand, as are Seth Gecko, Jake Steed, Serenity, Missy, and Nick East. Here is the ageless Randy West, who looks just the way a surfer would look if that surfer were also a Mob enforcer, with his perennial tan and hair like frozen surf. Mr. Jon Dough—winner of AVN’s coveted Best Actor/Video statuette in both ’96 and ’97—alternates between various booths, wearing his customary expression of having psychologically evolved to the point where he’s so incredibly cool and detached that life is one long yawn. Here also is Mark Davis, far and away the most handsome of the current males, a near-double for Gregory Harrison of the old Trapper John series except for Davis’s ultrashort psych-patient haircut (plus goatee).

And 20-year veteran Joey Silvera is at this year’s CES, though mostly in his capacity as an auteur: Silvera now directs Evil Angel’s popular “Butt Row” video series.12 Following the lead of pioneers like John Leslie and Paul Thomas, most of today’s top male stars now also direct (and, per the store boxes, “Present”) their own line of videos, e.g. “Tom Byron’s Cumback Pussy” series, “Jon Dough’s Dirty Stories,” the eye-popping Rocco Siffredi’s “[Various European Cities] By Night” line, etc. The So-and-So Presents series seems to be an industry trend, like cigars and goatees.

It is difficult to describe how it feels to gaze at living human beings whom you’ve seen perform in hard-core porn. To shake the hand of a man whose precise erectile size, angle, and vasculature are known to you. That strange I-think-we’ve-met-before sensation one feels upon seeing any celebrity in the flesh is here both intensified and twisted. It feels intensely twisted to see reigning industry queen Jenna Jameson chilling out at the Vivid booth in Jordaches and a latex bustier and to know already that she has a tattoo of a sundered valentine with the tagline HEART BREAKER on her right buttock and a tiny hairless mole just left of her anus. To watch Peter North try to get a cigar lit and to have that sight backlit by memories of his artilleryesque ejaculations.13 To have seen these strangers’ faces in orgasm—that most unguarded and purely neural of expressions, the one so vulnerable that for centuries you basically had to marry a person to get to see it.14 This weirdness may account for some of the complex emotional intercourse taking place between the performers and fans at the Adult CES. The patrons may leer and elbow one another at a distance, but by the time the men get to the front of the line and face the living incarnation of their VCR’s fantasy-babe, most of them turn into quivering goggle-eyed schoolboys, sheepish and salivaless and damp. The same thing evidently happens at the hundreds of strip clubs all over the country where porn starlets appear as Featured Dancers (for five figures a week, according to Filth) and do photos and autographs after the show:

“Most of these guys become incredibly nervous when I come up to them,” veteran starlet Shane has explained. “I’ll put my arms around a guy and his whole body will be trembling. They pretty much do whatever I tell them to do.” The whole industry, now, has this oddly reversed equation—the consumers are the ones who seem ashamed or shy, while the performers are cocky and smooth and 100 percent pro.
It is no longer the 1980s, and the Meese Commission mentality that led to a major crackdown on video porn is long gone. Federal task forces and PTA outrage are now focused on the Internet and kiddie porn. But today’s adult industry is still hypersensitive about what it perceives as fascist attacks on its First Amendment freedoms. A specially prepared trailer now runs before many higher-end adult videos, right between the legal disclaimer on the product’s compliance with or exemption from 18 U.S.C §2257 and ads for phone services like 900-666-FUCK. Against shots of flowing flags and the Lincoln Memorial, a voiceover says stuff like:

Censorship goes against our Bill of Rights and the founding principles of this country. It is an attempt on the part of the government to legislate morality and to stifle free expression.15 This new, “legal” morality is dangerous to all Americans. Vote for those who believe in limiting government intrusion into your personal affairs. Vote against government control of your life and home. Vote against censorship. Only you, the People, can keep the American ideal intact.

These trailers always say they’re sponsored by either the Adult Video Association or something called the Free Speech Coalition. Both organizations (and the extent to which the two are separate is unclear) are basically industry PACs. Porn, in other words, has taken the political lessons of the ’80s to heart; it is now a hard-lobbying political force no less than GM or RJR Nabisco.

Feminists of all different stripe oppose the adult industry for reasons having to do with pornography’s putative effects on women. Their arguments are well-known and in some respects persuasive. But certain antiporn arguments in the 1990s are now centered on adult entertainment’s alleged effects on the men who consume it. Some “masculists” believe that a lot of men get addicted to video porn in a way that causes grievous psychic harm. Example: An essayist named David Mura has a little book called A Male Grief: Notes on Pornography and Addiction, which is a bit New Agey but interesting in places, e.g.:

At the essence of pornography is the image of flesh used as a drug, a way of numbing psychic pain. But this drug lasts only as long as the man stares at the image… . In pornographic perception, each gesture, each word, each image, is read first and foremost through sexuality. Love or tenderness, pity or compassion, become subsumed by, and are made subservient to, a “greater” deity, a more powerful force… . The addict to pornography desires to be blinded, to live in a dream. Those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography, and this includes everything from their family and friends or last Sunday’s sermon to the political situation in the Middle East. In engaging in such elimination the viewer reduces himself. He becomes stupid.

This kind of stuff might sound a little out-there, maybe, until one observes the eerie similarity between the eyes of males in strip clubs or stroke parlors and the eyes of people in their fifth hour of pumping silver dollars into the slot machines of the Sands’ casino, or maybe until one’s seen firsthand the odd kind of shock on the faces of CES patrons seeing performers now “in the flesh,” complete with chewing gum and chin-pimples and all the human stuff you never see—never want to see—in films.

Maybe just a little bit more here on the whole scene at the Adult CES, which is a lot more of a rub-elbows-type venue than the stylized Awards ceremony is going to end up being… . Mr. Harold Hecuba is deep in conversation with a marginal porn producer about one of his performers’ being sidelined with something called a “prolapsed sphincter,” which condition yr. corresps. decline to follow up on in any way. We are standing just west of a staff writer for Digital Horizons who’s dropped by to scope out the legendary scene in here again this year and is telling two presumed other tech writers that being around porn people always makes him feel like he’s been somehow astrally projected onto a cocktail napkin. It is also roughly now that Ms. Jasmin St. Claire is making an appearance at the Impressive Media booth in order to spell the starlet behind the counter, who is limping to the booth’s rear area; she (i.e., the limping starlet) has (reportedly) had to be sprayed with silicon to fit into her pants. The crowd at the Impressive Media venue immediately starts to enlarge. Jasmin St. Claire is wearing a red vinyl jacket-and-miniskirt ensemble. A porn starlet entering any kind of room or area has a distinctive energy about her—you turn your head to look even if you don’t seem to want to. It’s like watching a figure from a pinball machine illustration or high-concept comic book step out into 3-D and head your way. It turns out really to be possible to feel as though your eyeballs are protruding slightly from their sockets. What makes the whole thing so weird is that Jasmin St. Claire isn’t even all that pretty, at least not today. Her hair is dyed black in that cheap unreal Goth way, and she is so incredibly heavily made up that she looks like a crow. (She is also somewhat knock-kneed, plus of course has the requisite Howitzer-grade bust.) Ms. St. Claire is being escorted to the Impressive booth by two large men whose expressions are describable only as mug-shottish. This is another thing about porn starlets—they’re never alone. They’re always accompanied by at least one and sometimes as many as four flinty-eyed males. The impression is that of a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket.

FYI, Ms. Jasmin St. Claire’s cult-celebrity status at the ’98 CES stems from her having broken the “World Gang Bang Record”16 by taking on 300 men in a row in Amazing Pictures’ 1996 World’s Biggest Gang Bang 2. Since most of these 300 men were amateur porn-fans who’d had only to fill out an application and produce an HIV all-clear from the DPH, she now enjoys an almost legendary populist appeal—“the People’s Porn Star”—and an enormous serpentine line of fans with cameras and autographable memorabilia has formed at the Impressive booth, which line Ms. St. Claire appears for the moment to be ignoring, because she and H. Hecuba, having exchanged double-cheek kisses, are now deep into some kind of tête-à-tête above the sockless Docksiders of the unconscious bald kid, who’s (the kid has) evidently been carried or trundled by pranksters unknown from the XPlor counter (right next door) to this one. Dick Filth—after your correspondents have remarked on how it’s kind of heartwarming that everyone in the porn industry all seem to be friends, even critics and performers—dishes an involved anecdote about how Jasmin St. Claire apparently once actually tried to strangle Harold Hecuba at an industry soirée a couple years ago, an anecdote which, if you’re interested, appears as FN17 just below. Twenty feet away, over at XPlor, Mr. Farrel Timlake has meanwhile produced what is alleged to be the prototype and world’s only authorized Kenny® Action Figure from the upcoming South Park merchandising line—fourteen inches tall, kind of heavy for a doll, w/ hood up and face obscured (not unlike F. Timlake’s own hood and face)—and is entertaining some of the IM crowd’s spillover by manipulating the doll’s limbs to simulate its “tok[ing] a bone.”

Not unlike urban gangs, police, carnival workers, and certain other culturally marginalized guilds, the US porn industry is occluded and insular in a way that makes it seem like high school. There are cliques, anticliques, alliances, betrayals, conflagratory rumors, legendary enmities, and public bloodlettings, plus involved hierarchies of popularity and influence. You’re either In or you’re not. Performers, being the industry’s fissile core, are of course In. Despite their financial power, studio execs and producers are not very In, and directors (especially those who’ve never undergone the initiation of having on-camera sex themselves) are less In than the performers. Film reviewers and industry journalists are even less In than execs; and nonindustry journalists are way, way non-In, almost as low-caste as the great mass of porn fans themselves (for which fans the Insider term is: mook18 ).

The foregoing is meant to help explain how exactly your correspondents ended up in porn titan Max Hardcore’s personal suite at the Sahara and got to hang out in the suite’s living room with Max, certain of his crew, porn starlets Alex Dane and Caressa Savage, and two B-girls—which is to say that it was actually Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth who were invited to hang out in the suite on Friday afternoon, but yr. corresps. clung almost like papooses to their backs, and the burly MAXWORLD Production Assistant wasn’t quick enough about slamming the door.
So yr. corresps. were, for a couple hours, at least logistically speaking, In.

For a regular civilian male, hanging out in a hotel suite with porn starlets is a tense and emotionally convolved affair. There is, first, the matter of having seen the various intimate activities and anatomical parts of these starlets in videos heretofore and thus (weirdly) feeling shy about meeting them. But there is also a complex erotic tension. Because porn films’ worlds are so sexualized, with everybody seemingly teetering right on the edge of coitus all the time and it taking only the slightest nudge or excuse—a stalled elevator, an unlocked door, a cocked eyebrow, a firm handshake—to send everyone tumbling into a tangled mass of limbs and orifices, there’s a bizarre unconscious expectation/dread/ hope that this is what might happen in Max Hardcore’s hotel room. Yr. corresps. here find it impossible to overemphasize the fact that this is a delusion. In fact, of course, the unconscious expectation/dread/hope makes no more sense than it would make to be hanging out with doctors at a medical convention and to expect that at the slightest provocation everyone in the room would tumble into a frenzy of MRIs and epidurals. Nevertheless the tension persists, despite the fact that the actresses are obviously tired and disassociated from the day’s CES,19 plus, it emerges, somewhat sore—it turns out that Max Hardcore is shooting one of his “Gonzo” porn spectaculars right here at the 1998 Consumer Electronics Show, using the CES as a hook and backdrop, and the girls have been alternating CES booth-duty and riding-crop shenanigans with a tight and SS-intensive filming schedule. (Max, being a firm believer in the fait accompli method of filmmaking, has not yet gotten around to chatting with the CES’s administration about his featuring the world’s biggest consumer-tech tradeshow by name in a “SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL” video.)

Mr. Max Hardcore—a.k.a. Max Steiner, a.k.a. Paul Steiner, né Paul Little—is 5'6"" and a very fit 135. He is somewhere between 40 and 60 years old and resembles more than anything a mesomorphic and borderline-psycho Henry Gibson. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and what has to be one of the very few long-sleeved Hawaiian shirts in existence anywhere. Once the PA guarding the door mellows out and introductions are made (H.H. managing to drop the name of this magazine several times in one sentence), Max reveals himself to be a genial and garrulous host and offers everybody disposable plastic cups of vodka before settling in with yr. corresps. to discuss what for Max are the most pressing and relevant issues at this year’s AVN Awards, which issues are the career, reputation, personal history, and overall life philosophy of Mr. Max Hardcore.

Pioneered (depending whom you talk to) by either Max Hardcore or John (“Buttman”) Stagliano, “Gonzo” has become one of this decade’s most popular and profitable genres of adult video. It’s more or less a cross between an MTV documentary and the Hell panel from Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights. A Gonzo film is always set at some distinctive locale or occasion—Daytona Beach at spring break, the Cannes Film Festival, etc. There’s always a randy and salivous “host” talking directly to a handheld camera: “Well and we’re here at the Cannes Film Festival, and it looks like there’s going to be lots of excitement, John Travolta and Sigourney Weaver are supposed to both be in town, and there’s also the world-famous beach, and I’m told there’s always some real seriously good-looking little girls at the beach, so let’s us head on down.” (That’s the approximate lead-in to a recent Max-at-Cannes Gonzo, a type of signature lead-in that Max refers to with a 56-tooth grin as “always mercifully brief”—and please note the “little girls at the beach” thing, because this is another of Max’s professional signatures, the infantilization of his videos’ females as dramatic foils for his own film persona, which is always that of a sort of degenerate uncle or stepdad.) Then the shaky but ever-focused camera heads on down to the ocean or mall or CES or whatever, scoping out attractive women20 while the host moans and chews his knuckle in lust. Then pretty soon host and camera start actually coming up to the women they’ve been looking at and engaging them in little cameo “interviews” full of sideways leers and salacious entendres. Some of the interviewees are actual civilians, but some are always what Max refers to as “ringers,” meaning professional porn actresses. And so the viewer is treated to the classic frathouse fantasy of moving, via just a couple of singles-bar “Hey there babe” lines, from scoping out an attractive woman to having wild and anatomically diverse sex with her, all while one of his buddies captures the whole thing on tape.21

The issue of who exactly invented Gonzo being impossibly vexed and so notwithstanding, it is true that Max Hardcore is famous as a director for several things: (1) Being incredibly disciplined about budgets and tactical logistics, right down to forcing his crew and staff to wear identical jumpsuits of scarlet nylon so that they look like a national ski team—Max’s shoots are described (by Max) as “almost military operations”; (2) Not only employing ringers but actually sometimes being able to talk real live civilian “little girls” on the beach or in the mall into coming on back to the special MAXWORLD RV and having anal sex on camera;22 (3) Being the first in “mainstream” (meaning nonfetish) adult video to perpetrate on women levels of violation and degradation that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. W/r/t item (3), Max, after detailing for yr. correspondents the vo- and avocations that led him into the adult industry (a tale too literally incredible even to think about factchecking and trying to print), informs us that he is and always has been adult video’s “cutting-edge blade,” and that other less bold and original filmmakers have systematically stolen and used his, Max’s, degradations of women as a blueprint for their own subsequent shabby and derivative films’ degradations.23 (Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, by the way, have heard Max hold forth many times before and are now outside the circle of discourse—D.F. in the bathroom for what seems like a peculiarly long time, H.H. on the couch with the actresses hashing out the implications of Seinfeld’s retirement for NBC’s ’98 lineup.)

Alone and in a place of conspicuous honor on a wood-finish shelf above the suite’s minibar is an actual AVN Awards statuette. The trophy resembles an Oscar/Emmy/Clio except that the figurine’s arms are up and out (making it also look a bit like Richard Nixon at the climax of the ’68 GOP convention), and something slightly blurry about the casting gives it a sort of cubic-zirconium aspect. Whether the statuette is heavy and solid vs. hollow and Little Leaguish remains unknown—there is no invitation to touch or heft it. One of the B-girls on the couch is now either laughing or weeping into her hands at something Harold Hecuba has said; her bare shoulders heave. It would be totally fantastic if the Seinfeld rerun on the huge TV were the episode about everybody trying to refrain from masturbating, but it isn’t.

Asked by one of yr. corresps. what he won this AVN Award on the shelf for, Max Hardcore slaps his knee: “I fucking stole it.” It’s now that hard middle-distance inspection reveals that the MAX HARDCORE on the metal strip at the trophy’s base has been scratched in by someone who is not a professional engraver. It looks done with a screwdriver, in fact. Max expands on the statuette caper: Shut inexplicably out of the Awards for years, he last year, upon exiting the stage (he’s always a presenter every year, which he regards as the AVNAs’ way of twisting the emotional blade), espied in the wings a large cardboard box filled with blank and unused AVN Award statuettes.24 Whereupon he thought, as he now puts it, “What the fuck, I fucking deserve it” and snagged one, hiding it in his enormous Stetson and deriving no little satisfaction from attending various post-Awards parties with an illicit statuette under his hat. Max’s crew all laugh very hard at this anecdote, though the actresses don’t.

Alex Dane is now telling Harold Hecuba about a stray dog she found and has decided to keep. She is excited as she describes the dog and for a moment seems about fourteen; the impression lasts only a second or two and is heartbreaking. One of the B-girls, meanwhile, is explaining that she has just gotten a pair of cutting-edge breast implants that she can actually adjust the size of by adding or draining fluid via small valves under her armpits, and then—perhaps mistaking your correspondents’ expressions for ones of disbelief—she raises her arms to display the valves. There really are what appear to be valves.

So much about today’s adult industry seems like an undeft parody of Hollywood and the nation writ large. The top performers are comic-book caricatures of sexual allure. The prosthetic breasts and lifted buttocks and (no kidding) artificial cheekbones are nothing more than accentuations of a mentality that yields huge liposuction and collagen industries. The gynecologically explicit sexuality of Jenna, Jasmin, et al. seems more than anything like a Mad magazine spoof of the “smoldering” sexuality of Sharon Stone and Madonna and so many other mainstream iconettes.25 Not to mention the fact that the adult industry takes many of the psychological deformities that Hollywood is famous for—the vanity, the vulgarity, the rank commercialism—and not only makes them overt and grotesque but seems then to revel in that grotesquerie.

Good old Max Hardcore, for instance, is a total psychopath—that’s part of his on-screen Gonzo persona—but so is the real Max/Paul Steiner. You’d almost have to have been there in that suite. Max sits holding court in his hat and pointy boots, looking at once magisterial and mindless, while his red-suited acolytes laugh on cue and a jr. high dropout shows off her valves. In truth, the first ten minutes of the impromptu interview in the Sahara are spent passing around a copy of something called Icon magazine, which Max has told us is doing a profile on him—we are expected to leaf through the magazine and comment favorably on its content and layout while Max watches us in the same hyperexpectant way that parents watch you when you’re looking at a snapshot of their kid that they’ve taken out uninvited and pressed on you. This is the actual chronology. There then follows a torrent of autobiography and background that yr. corresps. have decided to deny Max the satisfaction of seeing reproduced here. After which is a kind of Max 101-like survey of personal philosophy and Gonzo theory and the statuette anecdote. The vodka is top-shelf and the plastic cups dusty. Then one of the starlets decides that she’s hungry, and Max insists on escorting her down to the Sahara’s restaurant and wants everybody else to come along, which eventually results in the B-girls and crewmen and yr. corresps.26 all standing there awkwardly at the maître d’s podium while Max personally conducts the starlet to her table and pulls out her chair and tucks a serviette into her cleavage and pulls out a platinum-plated money clip and announces in a voice audible to everyone in the restaurant and foyer that he “want[s] to take care of the little girl’s damages in advance” and shoves bills into the hanky-pocket of the maître d’s tuxedo and then leaves her there by herself and herds us all back out and into the elevator and jabs impatiently at the button for his suite’s floor, almost jumping up and down with fury at the elevator’s delay; and we’re all rushed back up to the suite because it’s occurred to Max that he wants to show your corresps. something from this week’s filming that he thinks will sum up his particular porn genius better than any amount of exposition could … and then, reseated, he starts flipping through a notebook to find something.

“What it is is we got this one little girl back in the [infamous MAXWORLD] trailer, and after some face-fucking27 and reaming her asshole and, like, your standard depravities, we get her to stick a pen—no, a what-do-you-call …”

Crewman: “Magic Marker.”

Max: “… Magic Marker, stick it up her asshole and write all this … this stuff,” holding up the notebook, opened to a page; again he has us pass it around:

is thereon written in a hand28 that seems impressively legible, considering. Dick Filth makes a waggish inquiry about future film plans involving this girl and a typewriter, but Max doesn’t laugh (we noticed that Max never laughs at a joke he hasn’t told), and so neither does anyone else.

Doubtless most of this is going to get cut by Premiere, but it’s worth also observing—when this magazine’s assigned photographer (who’s also gotten in here with us this afternoon on H.H. and D.F.’s coattails) begins wondering aloud about the possibility of getting some good portraits at the Awards of winners holding their statuettes—the way Max right away jumps in with his idea of the perfect photo for the title page of this very article. The proposed shot is to be of Max Hardcore, holding several of the AVN Awards trophies he pledges either to win straight up or to gain possession of in other ways, seated in some kind of imperial-looking and really nice chair that is itself set up on the palm-studded boulevard of the famous Las Vegas Strip—so the photographer’ll get lots of smeary neon and appropriately phallic bldgs. in the background—with a retinue of scantily clad starlets either draped swoonily over him or prostrate at his feet, or both. It is important to note that there are no audible scare-quotes, no irony or embarrassment or self-awareness of any sort on Max’s face as he sketches this photo’s tableau for us; he’s in the kind of earnest that one imagines Irving Thalberg was always in.29 Your correspondents immediately begin to lobby hard for Max’s idea, figuring that the photo would make a great illustration for the story of Max’s proposing this very photo—i.e., that it would point up the megalomania far more powerfully than mere reportage—but the Premiere photographer, who is no actor, does such a poor job of disguising his repulsion at Max’s self-regard that the atmosphere of the whole suite gets stilted and complexly hostile, and the rest of the interview is kind of a fizzle-yield, and overall Dick Filth said that we failed, in his phrase, to “penetrate to the core of the essence of what it is to be Max Hardcore.”30

The 15th Annual AVN Awards are actually split over two consecutive nights, a tactic that Max H. thought the legit Oscars would do well to emulate: “Get all the bullshit out of the way the first night—best packaging, marketing, best gay, shit like that. Who wants to sit through that shit?”

Held in a different, slightly smaller Caesars Palace ballroom, Friday’s Awards show is indeed brisk. The ephemeral categories include Best Videography, Best Screenplay, Best Art Direction, Best Music. Each category’s nominees are listed in the program, but only the winners are announced onstage, and they’re announced four at a time, and applause is discouraged, and the master of ceremonies keeps telling the quartets of winners that “If you’ll come on up quickly and help keep things moving it’ll help us out a lot.” Friday’s only food is big wheels of vegetables and dip near the cash bar. The emcee is not headliner Robert Schimmel but a hypomanic guy named Dave Tyree, whose interpolated banter is 78 rpm and consists of stuff like “If God didn’t want us to jerk off he would’ve made our arms shorter.” There are maybe 1,000 people in attendance, most only slightly dressed up, and there are no assigned tables, and everybody in the ballroom is moving around and chattering and treating the onstage proceedings the way people in a cocktail lounge treat the piano player.

Q. $4,000,000,000 and 8,000 new releases a year—why is adult video so popular in this country?
A. Director and AVN-Hall-of-Fame inductee F. J. Lincoln: “It’s always a little funny how it’s called adult. What it really is, you get to be a kid again. You roll around and get dirty. It’s the adult sandbox.”
A. Veteran woodman Joey Silvera: “Dudes, let’s face it—America wants to jerk off.”
A. Industry journalist Harold Hecuba: “It’s the new Barnum. Nobody ever goes broke overestimating the rage and misogyny of the average American male.”
A. Porn starlet Jacklyn Lick: “I think a lot of fans are very lonely people.”
Q. There don’t seem to be a whole lot of condoms used in hard-core scenes.
A. Harold Hecuba: “Never have been. They’re viewed as a turn-off. This business is about engineering fantasies.”
Q. But even just venerially—all these anal shenanigans and everything. Is there much worry in the industry about HIV?
A. Harold Hecuba: “There’s not as much worry about AIDS now. Everybody gets tested on a schedule.”
Q. What about herpes?
A. H.H.: “I think it’s rampant.”

Last year’s Best-Sex-Scene-in-a-Film winner Vince Vouyer’s real name turns out to be John LaForme. Rhetorical Q.: How, if one’s real name was John LaForme, could that person possibly feel the need for a nom de guerre?

Mr. Tom Byron describes being able to tumesce and ejaculate more or less on demand as an exercise in “control, like meditation or surfing. It’s like a gymnast staying on the balance beam. You practice enough, you can do anything.”31

Former woodman and current auteur Paul Thomas was a member of the original Broadway cast of Jesus Christ Superstar.

The tall, crazed-looking, and ever-rampant Mike Horner, three-time Best Actor winner and a member of the AVN Hall of Fame,32 is actually a classically trained opera singer.

Deceased starlet Nancy Kelly’s real name was Kelly Van Dyke. She was the daughter of TV’s Jerry Van Dyke and so, of course, the niece of Dick.

Exotic rookie actress Midori, one of the nominees in the ’98 AVNAs’ Best New Starlet category, is the sister of ’80s pop star Jodi Whatley. Midori has stated publicly that she views upscale contemporary porn as a stepping-stone to a mainstream career, not unlike becoming Miss America or doing a couple seasons on SNL. Harold Hecuba characterizes Midori’s career strategy as “grievously ill-advised.”

Adult Video News VP and Executive Editor Gene Ross, presenting the aforementioned 1998 AVN Award for Best Director/Video to Miscreants’ Rob Black, will hail Mr. Black as “a guy who can take buttholes, midgets, and fried fish, and make a love story.”33

From The New Yorker’s 1995 article on the psychosexual plight of the adult industry’s woodman: “The Cal Jammers who are part of this feminization feel they have stormed the walls of female ornament to reclaim male prerogative, only to find themselves lost in a garden of gender irony.”

Mr. John “Buttman” Stagliano—CEO of Evil Angel Inc., a man described by US News & World Report as “the nation’s leading director of hard-core videos”—not only has publicly announced testing positive for HIV but has identified the infection’s vector as a transsexual prostitute in São Paulo with whom Stagliano had unprotected anal intercourse in 1995. He’s anxious that people not get the wrong idea: “I am not particularly interested in guys, but I am interested in dicks. Forbidden taboos lead to all sorts of neurotic behavior, which leads to me being fucked in the ass without a rubber.”

Are the AVN Awards possibly rigged? Max Hardcore (he of the purloined statuette, keep in mind) calls the Awards “a total conflict of interests.” After all, he explains, Adult Video News is heavily ad-dependent,34 and they’re under “pressure from the big hitters like Vivid and VCA to like, you know, give the nod.”

Ms. Ellen Thompson, AVN Associate Editor and an Awards judge who votes under the n.d.g. Ida Slapter:35 “We’ve heard this for years. I hear this complaining also goes on in the mainstream. I don’t like insulting anybody, but sometimes there’s sour grapes. What are we supposed to say? Vivid and VCA put out good product. We truly, honestly do vote fairly.”

Mr. Dick Filth: “The best perception, backed up by tons of anecdotal evidence, is that they are totally, totally fixed and rigged.”
Saturday’s the big night. The banquet, the onstage entertainment, the headline Awards. See & be seen. Gamblers and conventioneers and mooks of all ilk are massed at the Caesars cabstand to watch the starlets arrive. There are camcorders and flashbulbs but no paparazzi per se. Some of the performers come in limos, others in shiny penile sports cars; others seem to mysteriously just suddenly appear. There are even more starlets here than there were at the CES, and they are seriously dolled up. There are cerise halters and pear-colored Lycra bodysuits with open-toed pumps of burgundy suede. There are platinum lamé gowns slit all the way to the tenth rib. Bottoms less covered than shellacked look like they by all rights should have panty- or at least thong lines but do not have such lines. There are lime-green vinyl leotards and toile bellbottoms and fishscale bustiers and miniskirts the same texture and length as a tutu’s ruffle. Garter straps flash and Merry Widow bodices shade the interiors of translucent blouses. Several of the outfits defy very basic precepts of modern physics. Coiffures are towering and complex. The starlets are all on the arms of men, but none of these escorts are male porn performers. Average heel-height is 4""+. A loud-voiced civilian in the cabstand crowd actually utters the phrase “Va Va Voom,” which yr. correspondents had never before heard anywhere outside a Sinatra movie. Breasts are uniformly zeppelinesque and in various perilous stages of semiconfinement. Max Hardcore is under a Stetson the color of weak chocolate milk, and his adjustable B-girl—arrayed in a type of scarlet cowboy suit that’s mostly fringe—has inflated her breasts to what’s got to be maximum capacity.

Woodman-wise, black is clearly In at the 15th Annual AVNAs. A lot of the men are in black tuxedos and black ties and black dress shirts. One is wearing a paisley suit of either serge or some kind of upholstery material. Another has silver platform shoes and a silver vest w/ no shirt underneath. The XPlor boys are in Klein sweatshirts and urban-camouflage fatigues, and there’s a large contingent with them that may or may not include the South Park brain trust. A guy on the arm of Ms. Morgan Fairlane has an immense and razorous violet mohawk à la British punks of the late 1970s.

Inside the hotel, a kind of impromptu cocktail party forms in the broad marble hall outside Caesars Palace’s largest and reportedly classiest ballroom, which is called Caesars Forum. Burly casino staffers stand taking tickets and being very discouraging about anybody trying to bum-rush the show. The crush of bodies out here entails a degree of physical contact that CES mooks never even dreamed of. There are pockets of klieg-glare as cable TV reporters interview various performers about (sic:) the air of keen excitement in the air. Mysterious bundles of co-ax emerge from under the Forum doors and go all the way up the length of the hallway and disappear around the corner. A suspicion that we’d had all week but decided was unverifiable is now instantly verified when one of yr. corresps. gets accidentally shoved against a starlet and is jabbed in the side by her breasts and it hurts. A lot of people are holding drinks in plastic glasses and it’s unknown where they got them. The starlets take turns getting interviewed re atmospheric excitement while the woodmen all avoid the cameras like mafiosi. The TV lights are not doing anyone’s skin tone any good at all. In their all-black tuxes, several of the male Insiders—including e.g. John Leslie and Tony Tedeschi—are so pallid and sallow as to appear diseased. Mr. Nick East devotes a full 5.5 minutes of rapt concentration to the cuticle of his left thumb. A slight surprise is that a lot of the industry’s elite woodmen are short—5'6"", 5'7""36 —and most of their companions tower over them. Dick Filth confirms that the contemporary industry’s 5'6"" standard helps a prodigious male organ look even more prodigious on videotape, a medium that apparently does all kinds of strange things to perspective.

Tickets for Saturday’s main event are $195 per, in advance. It’s unclear whether any Insiders’ tickets are comped, but journalists pay full retail. Our tickets designate our table as #189. Twenty-five hundred tickets have been sold, and since it’s highly doubtful that anybody got past the flinty-eyed casino guys outside without a ticket, tonight’s attendance can confidently be fixed at 2,500.
The Caesars Forum ballroom itself is a huge L-shape with the stage at the—as it were—joint; thus half of the 15th Annual AVN Awards’ audience is geometrically invisible to the other half. This problem is addressed via six sail-sized video screens that hang from the ceiling at strategic points throughout the auditorium. During the nearly two hours37 between when the doors open and the Awards show actually starts, the screens alternate quick clips from porn classics38 (recall that the theme of the 15th AAVNAs is “The History of Adult”) with live shots of various people making their entrances and mugging for the remote cameras AVN has got circling the room.

Both Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth have come equipped with binoculars (H.H.’s in a very official-looking Audubon Society case), which seems mysterious until we all arrive at Table 189, which is at the very, very back of the ballroom’s L’s northern leg, hundreds of yards from even the nearest video screen. “They always put the print guys out in mookland,” Hecuba explains. This fact is unpleasant surprise #1. Unpleasant surprise #2 is the supper the $195 includes, which turns out to be buffet-steam-table-style and might best be described by inviting you to imagine a very cosmopolitan and multiethnic hospital cafeteria. 39 Several of the male Insiders, we now notice, have brought in their own picnic hampers.

Now moving w/ laden plate to a table near us is a man in a full-body leopardskin suit whose way of acknowledging people he knows is to point at them rather than wave at them. On his arm is a B-girl in a body stocking made of what appears to be a densely woven net. Two Astral Ocean Cinema contract starlets have on identical copper-colored beaded gowns with myriad lengthwise slits in the skirt parts’ fronts and backs and sides, so that as they walk to their table their upper halves look normal and their lower halves seem to be passing through an infinity of bead curtains. Obviously, the whole scene is overwhelming. The average American rarely gets to see aerobic legwarmers with 4"" spike heels. The Caesars Forum ceiling is the color of rancid meringue; it has 24 chandeliers that are designed to look like concentric opened fans but actually look more like labia or very well-organized fungus. Mr. Joey Buttafuoco is in the house, accompanying40 Al Goldstein of Screw, who is here to receive a Special AVN Achievement Award for His Lifelong Defense of the First Amendment. Black is so resoundingly In this year that even the starched linen napkins at everyone’s place settings are black. The wineglasses all have little frosted cameos of J. Caesar on them. Humorless men with walkie-talkies stand guard at each of the ballroom’s fire doors—apparently last year there were some problems with unauthorized Caesars Palace employees sneaking in to watch the gala. The video screens are now showing the climactic scene of Debbie Does Dallas, the one where the nebbishy little stand-in for all mooks everywhere finally has sex with Bambi Woods and then the screen flashes “NEXT?” The South Park boys are indeed in attendance, up at Table 37 w/ Farrel and the XPlor coterie. There are also rumors that Boogie Nights auteur Paul Thomas Anderson possesses a ticket to the gala and might show up.41

The closest thing to any kind of Insider table near ours is #182, which according to its black table-tent is reserved for Anabolic Video (not an industry force) and is currently occupied by a spiriferously coiffed and sullenly chewing Dina Jewel (who declines to return Harold Hecuba’s blown kiss) and her escort, a young fellow whom one can easily envision head-butting somebody in a mosh pit. D. Filth confides that this Anabolic guy is a close friend of woodman Vince Vouyer (again, sic), who himself is not up for many ’98 Awards because he spent a good part of the past year in court and/or detention for helping operate an escort service which authorities alleged was not a bona fide escort service at all.

It turns out that Hecuba and Filth have kept from yr. correspondents as unpleasant surprise #3 the single chintziest thing about the $195-a-head 15th AAVNAs banquet & gala: Beverages are not compris. And not just alcohol, either; even a lousy club soda w/ lime42 is $6.00. Worse, it turns out you can’t run any sort of tab—you have to pay the waiter in cash when you order the lousy club soda w/ lime, and he (theoretically) brings your change back with the beverage. Thus a separate and memory-intensive transaction is required for each drink that each of the six-to-eight persons at each of the appr. 375 tables in the auditorium might order, with additional complications if certain people are buying drinks for certain tablemates but not for certain other tablemates, etc.43 The whole unfree-drink situation is incredibly annoying, not only because of the outlandish ticket price but because the ballroom’s 100 percent Middle Eastern waiters (decent and hardworking fellows all, to be sure, who are taking some serious abuse about the pay-as-you-go beverage policy from mooks with cigars at the nearby tables, despite the fact that the waiters don’t make the rules and must surely find having to remember and make change for six to eight different customers per table a piercing pain in the ass44 ) have only rudimentary ESL skills and tend to confuse both drink orders and currency denominations. Dick Filth leans over and shouts: “Now you can maybe see why this is a multibillion-a-year industry—they’re tight as a duck’s butt!”45

The crowd lingers over hypersucrotic cake and coffee and $9.00 cordials and howls conversation at itself for 90 more minutes before the house lights dim and the 15th Annual AVN Awards gala starts. What follows thereon is a kaleidoscopic flux of stilted acceptances and blue one-liners and epileptic strobes and spotlights following winners’ serpentine and high five-studded paths to the stage, of everything from generic Awards Show schmaltz to moments of near-Periclean eloquence, as in e.g.:

“Fellow MENSA members and aficionados of Shakespeare!” intones Al Goldstein of Screw, 62 and obese and white-bearded and crazy-haired and dressed in a sportcoat whose lapels are two different primary colors, looking pretty much exactly like that one certain old guy in the neighborhood your mom warned you never to try to sell Cub Scout chocolate mints to, and glorying in a Special AVN Achievement Award he confesses to feeling he’s long deserved. “I want to thank my mother, who spread her legs and made all this possible.” Large sections of the crowd are on their feet—Goldstein is a porn icon. He was distributing NYC’s Screw on photostat when most of the people in this room were still playing with their toes. He’s been a First Amendment ninja. He drinks in the applause and loves it and is hard not to sort of almost actually like. He’s clearly an avatar of contemporary porn’s unabashedness, its modern Yeah-OK-I’m-Scum-but-Underneath-All-Your-Hypocrisy-So- Are-You-and-at-Least-I-Have-the-Guts-to-Admit-It-and-Have-a-Good-Time persona:

“I salute the women with eleven-IQs and the men with eleven-inch cocks. The real heroes are the cocks and pussies who fuck on-screen. They’re the real heroes.” Goldstein is less conducted than borne back to his seat.

This has followed Robert Schimmel’s intro and a 20-minute “Musical Salute to the History of Adult,” in which topless dancing girls do a medley of disco, new wave, and so on.46 The stage band is ragged and unevenly amplified, and they all have flared collars and tight perms—it’s like watching The Brady Bunch’s final season through borrowed binoculars. The stage is lit by autotrack spotlights whose colors alternate w/o discernible scheme.

The whole 15th AAVNAs Show lasts 3.5 hours and resembles nothing so much as an obscene and extremely well-funded high school assembly. The mix of garish self-congratulation47 and clumsy choreography is often so weird as to be endearing. There are never fewer than six presenters for each award, and they never seem to know whose turn it is to announce a nominee, and there are always a couple who don’t get close enough to the mike to be audible and a couple others who get too close to the mike and produce a jolt of feedback that sends people and cocktails flying out of chairs in the first rows of tables. Wicked Pictures’ Satyr, a multiple-category nominee, gets repeatedly pronounced “Satter.” Winners are supposed to exit stage-left after their acceptance speeches, but even people who’ve won and been through the process several times in recent years keep forgetting and trying to exit stage-right and colliding with the hostesses who are there to escort them leftward. Some presenters insert brief rote antidrug messages into their intros, while around them twitch and sniff other presenters—not many, but some—who are obviously coked to the gills.

Probably the most neutral and economical thing to say is that large parts of the ceremony are unintentionally funny. Winning woodmen extend earnest thanks to directors and execs for giving them “an opening” or “a shot” or “my big shot” and seem wholly unaware of the carnal entendres involved. Back at the journalists’ table with us is a 40ish woman in two-piece Armani who’s doing a spot on the Awards for ABC Radio; she spends most of the evening hunched over with her head in her hand and her tape recorder not even on. Dick Filth spends the show’s whole second hour trying to track down a waiter who owes him beverage change. AVN’s Gene Ross pays tribute to ’98’s Male Performer of the Year by saying: “You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Tom Byron’s wrinkled nuts on a seventy-inch TV screen.” Rob Black’s Miscreants keeps getting nominated in category after category, and time and again there’s a frantic caucus at the podium about the correct pronunciation of miscreant, complete with a couple of presenters audibly whispering what in the fuck is the word even supposed to mean.48

To be fair, some of the nominated products’ titles are genuinely confusing. Triple Penetration Debutante Sluts 4 is up for Most Outrageous Sex Scene—along with Wild Bananas on Butt Row and 87 and Still Bangin’—but loses out to a scene the Program entitles “Anal Food Express”49 from a video called My Girlfriend’s Girlfriend. Paul Thomas’s Bad Wives wins Best Film. Evil Angel’s Buda wins Best Shot-on-Video Feature. The Best Foreign Release statuette goes to something European called President By Day, Hooker By Night. Bad Wives also wins Best Actress/Film for Dyanna Lauren, Best Supporting Actress/Film for Melissa Hill, and Best Anal Sex Scene/Film50 for Lauren and Steven St. Croix. Best Compilation Tape honors go to The Voyeur’s Favorite Blow Jobs & Anals. David Cronenberg’s mainstream Crash comes out of absolutely nowhere to win something called Best Alternative Adult Feature Film. Ms. Stephanie Swift wins Best Actress/Video and tells the crowd: “Thanks, everybody. My gang bang was a blast.”51

Max Hardcore, to Table 189’s immense and unkind delight, doesn’t win one single thing.

An actor named Jim Buck wins AVN’s Gay Performer of the Year Award, and you better believe yr. corresps. sit bolt upright when the person who appears onstage to accept the award is a pink and leptosomatic 4'10"" and is wearing an Eton collar and appears, even under 125X binoculation, to be a twelve-year-old boy. And it turns out it is a twelve-year-old boy: It’s Jim Buck’s little brother. “Jim can’t be here tonight because he’s performing in a Shakespeare festival in New Orleans,” the little boy says (correspondential expressions of bug-eyed inquiry at Hecuba and Filth—Shakespeare festival? sending a prepubescent relative to collect your excellence-in-filmed-sodomy prize?—are met with bemused shrugs), “but I’m here to thank you on his behalf, and to say that I taught Jim everything he knows.” [Enormous audience laugh and ovation, single spasmodic shudder from hunched ABC Radio lady.]

A strange and traumatic experience which one of yr. corrs. will not even try to describe consists of standing at a men’s room urinal between professional woodmen Alex Sanders and Dave Hardman. Suffice it to say that the urge to look over/down at their penises is powerful and the motives behind this urge so complex as to cause anuresis (which in turn ups the trauma). Be informed that male porn stars create around themselves the exact same opaque affective privacy- bubble that all men at urinals everywhere create. The whole Caesars Forum’s men’s room’s urinal area is an angst festival; take it from us. The sink-and-mirror-and-towelette area, however, turns out to be a priceless mash of Insider jargon and shoptalk, all made extra-resonant by echolalic tile and a surfeit of six-dollar drinks. One performer-turned-auteur is telling a colleague about an exciting new project:

“Found this Russian, this chick like nineteen, can’t speak a word of English, which for this [ = for the exciting project] is perfect.”

“You going to get in there? Just for maybe like one scene?”

“Nah. That’s the whole point. I’m the director. This is my package now.”

“Oh man though but you got to get in there. Just one scene. Nineteen, no English. Probably got a butthole about this big” [illustrative gesture unseen because auditor is still standing complexly traumatized at urinal].

“Well, we’ll see.” [Mutual laughter replete w/ warmth of genuine friendship, fellow-feeling; exeunt.]

The Awards Show’s planners have obviously studied at the Oscars’ feet. Not only are the high-profile AVNAs held to the end—though with occasional teasers like Best Supporting thrown into the first two-thirds to keep people attentive52 —but the endless lists of categories and nominees are interspersed with little entr’actes of musical entertainment. Ms. Dyanna Lauren, for instance, appears between Best-Selling Tape and Best Foreign Release to sing her original composition “Psycho Magnet,” a hard-rock ballad about being a porn star and getting constantly stalked and harassed by mentally ill mooks. The song’s argumentation strikes yr. corresps. as a bit uneven, but Ms. Lauren struts and contorts and punctuates her phrasing with uppercuts to the air like a genuine MTV diva. The downside is that vocally, even with heavy amplification and digital synthesis, Dyanna Lauren sounds like a scalded cat, although Dick Filth points out that so does Alanis Morissette, and H. Hecuba chimes in by shouting: “Say whatever you want about the song-and-dance numbers here, they sure beat what Wahlberg and Reilly were coming up with in Boogie Nights!”

Hecuba’s claim seems unassailable until right before the Best Boxcover Concept category, when suddenly a piano is wheeled out for a chinless middle-aged man in the same sort of undersize porkpie that Art Carney always wore in The Honeymooners. This entertainer, who is introduced as “Doctor Dirty—the Dirtiest Musician in the History of Music,” proceeds to belt out obscene parodies of popular ditties that put Table 189 in mind of Mad magazine if everyone at Mad somehow all lost their mind at the same time. “Just got home from prison./My asshole is fizzin’./Goo goo goo drippin’ out my back door” is the only snatch of actual lyrics that persists in memory, though titles like “Sit on a Happy Face” and “It’s a Small Dick After All” have proved maddeningly hard to forget. Nobody at or around our table has ever heard of Doctor Dirty before, but almost everyone agrees that he’s the ’98 gala’s low point and a credible rival for Scotty Schwartz’s 1997 seminude rendition of “Thank Heaven for Little Girls” as the most repellent AVNA interlude in modern memory. There’s also the ’98 ceremony’s climax, in which Midori53 and two other starlets take the stage as “the Spicy Girls” and do a rappish 4/4 number that ends with pretty much every female porn performer in the crowd54 up on stage dancing lasciviously and blowing kisses at the AVN cameras. This climactic distaff shindig apparently caps the Awards every year.

Something else happens every year. It’s never part of AVN’s videotape of the gala, but it’s a tradition that finally explains why the ballroom’s poor waiters are willing to spend five hours enduring beverage abuse and scuttling around to find change. After the Awards Show is over and the lights go up, some of the starlets always pose for obscene snapshots with the Forum’s waiters. A lot of this year’s picture-taking happens at the back, right near our table. One waiter stands with his arm around the shoulders of Leanna Hart, who pulls down the starboard side of her strapless taffeta and allows the waiter to cup her right breast while Table 189’s own personal waiter55 snaps the photo. Another waiter goes around behind Ms. Ann Amoré—a very personable black lady with a 50-inch bust and gang tattoos all down both arms—and hunches over behind her as she bends forward and releases her breasts from confinement, and the waiter paws them and tries to look like he’s having intercourse with her from behind as his friend’s flash goes off. What the waiters are going to do with these photos is unguessable, but they’re visibly thrilled, and the starlets are patient and obliging with them in the same blank, distant way that they were with the mooks at the Adult CES.

Trying to leave after the AAVNAs gala is another slow process, because the broad hallway outside the ballroom is again filled with industry people with Caesar-cameo’d glasses they’ve somehow forgotten to leave at their tables, all standing in clumps and congratulating one another and making plans for various Insider parties later. But the slowest, scariest egressive part is traversing the long glass vestibule to the hotel’s side exit. A mass of fans and Caesars Palace custodians and assorted other civilians are there, and the crowd parts slightly to allow a narrow passage for the Awards’ attendees, who must run this gauntlet nearly single file. It’s late, and everyone’s tired, and this crowd has none of the awestruck reticence of the cabstand’s spectators earlier. Now it’s like every mook has his own special high-volume comment for the passing stars, and there’s a weird mix of adulation and derision:

“Love you, Brittany!”

“How’d you get that dress on, baby?”

“Look over here!”

“Does your mother know where you’re at right now?”

One florid 30ish man holding a plastic cup of beer now reaches out from the crowd and very deliberately pinches the breast of the B-girl walking just in front of us. She slaps his hand away without breaking stride. Because we cannot see her face, we don’t know whether there is any reaction there at all. We have an informed guess, though.

Mr. Dick Filth is behind us with one hand on each of yr. corresps.’ shoulders (we’re basically supporting him out). Everyone’s ears are still ringing, and Filth knows enough to almost shout:

“You know,” he says, “we’ve also got the XRCO Awards in February. X-Rated Critics Organization Awards—you get me? They’re not in Vegas, and they’re not rigged. And yet they manage to be just as ridiculous.”"

Ooh

[Verse 1]
Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don’t cry, you don’t care
Afraid to have a love affair

Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

Ooh, oh

Weather on a sunny day
Time slows down; I wish you’d stay
Pass me by in crowded, dark hallways
Mm
Try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

I heard you say you needed me now
What’s the problem? I can’t see
You destroyed me, I won’t fall apart again
I’m not falling apart
Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?

Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again

Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it so

Without you I'll be miserable at best

You're all that I hoped I'd find
In every single way
And everything I would give
Is everything you couldn't take

Is just taking breaths to stay
Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet

That I'll talk to you and I can't speak

But we both know that I'm not that strong and
I miss the lips that made me fly, so

Into the city where I live
And I saw my old landlord
Well we both said, ""Hello""
There was no where else to go
'Cause his rent I couldn't afford

Well relationships change
Though I think its kind of strange
How money makes a man grow
Ah, some people they claim
If you get enough fame
You live over the rainbow, over the rainbow

But the people on the street
Out on buses or on feet
We all got the same blood flow
Oh in society every dollar got a deed
We all need a place that we can go
And feel over the rainbow

Sometimes we forget what we got
Who we are or who we are not
I think we got a chance to make it right
Keep it loose, keep it tight, keep it tight

I'm in love with a girl who's in love with the world
Though I cant help but follow
Though I know someday she is bound to go away
And stay over the rainbow
Got to learn how to let her go
Over the rainbow

But sometimes we forget who we got
Who they are or who they are not
There is so much more in love than black and white
Keep it loose child, gotta keep tight
Keep it loose, keep it tight, keep it tight
Keep it tight, yeah"

Our step mom we did everything to hate her
She took us down to the edge of Decatur
We saw the lion and the kangaroo take her
Down to the river where they caught a wild alligator

Sangamon River it overflowed
It caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator
Civil war skeletons in their graves
They came up clapping in the spirit of the aviator

The sound of the engines and the smell of the grain
We go riding on the abolition grain train
Stephen A. Douglas was a great debater
But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator

Chickenmobile with your rooster tail
I had my fill and I know how bad it feels
Stay awake and watch for the data
No small Caterpillar, go congratulate her

It's the great I Am
Abominate her, go Decatur, why did we hate her?

How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror
So how do you choose?

And your hair never falls in quite the same way

Just to put up with this every day and all day?
Now how did we wind up this way
Watching our mouths for the words that we say?
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes or the soles that we choose
Now how do we get there today
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes?

We will not ever be eighteen again, again

And every night, you leave crying
And I, I could use some time
Here I am, there you go again, again

So, here I am and I'm dying
And I'm waiting for you, waiting for you
Come back, come back to me
And I'll take you gladly, well, I'll take you any time

Sip on the southern rain

And what they played was a masquerade
And from behind of walls of doubt a voice was crying out

Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you

Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn; a bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free

That much is understood

I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

And with a sad heart, I say bye to you and wave
Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

[Hook]
Hate me today
Hate me tomorrow
Hate me for all the things I didn't do for you
Hate me in ways
Yeah, ways hard to swallow
Hate me so you can finally see what’s good for you
For you
For you
For you

How could the silence be so loud?
But I still go home knowing that I've got you
There's only us when the lights go down

You are my hunger, my thirst

Was losing all my friends, but I got them back
I am on the mend
At least now I can say that I am trying
And I hope you will forget things I still lack

Is it in you now
To bear to hear the truth that you have spoken?
Twisted up by knaves
To make a trap for fools
Is it in you now
To watch the things you gave your life to broken?
And stoop and build them up with worn out tools

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

Nothing gets so bad
A whisper from your father couldn't fix it

And turn it into something you would miss if
Somebody threw that brick, shattered all your plans

Colors she left in your black and white field?
Do you feel condemned just being there?

Look out for dreams that keep returning
'Cause magic ain't no hand-me-down yearning
You feel it, you want it, the way I want you babe

Traveling by choo-choo train
We know where, we just don't know when
Like some everlasting onion peeled by love

Never heard a better bad joke said out loud
You flip-flop and I wild out
Can you believe it
I can't believe it but it's true

You're giving eighty billion years of giggling
A whole new world to live in
But this one's real, this one's real, this one's real

Like a bow tied kangaroo
You be one and I'll be one too
We play it goofy or we play it cool
I don't mind

Everything that happened
You know it don't mean a thing to us
'Cause so much is gonna happen
Because

You showed me a sunset overflowing
But who cares where it's going
As long as you're next to me"

You’re the loser, I won’t dismiss you out of hand
You’ve got a beautiful face
It will take you places

You kept running
You’ve got money, you’ve got fame
Every morning I see your picture from the train
Now you’re an actress
So says your résumé
You’re made of card
You couldn’t act your way out of a paper bag

You got lucky, you ain’t talking to me now
Little Miss Plucky
Pluck your eyebrows for the crowd
Get on the airplane
You give me stomach pain
I wish that you were here
We would have had a lot to talk about

We had a deal there
We nearly signed it with our blood
An understanding
I thought that you would keep your word
I’m disappointed
I’m aggravated
It’s a fault I have, I know
When things don’t go my way I have to

Blow up in the face of my rivals
I swear and I rant, I make quite an arrival
The men are surprised by the language
They act so discreet, they are hypocrites, so fuck them too

I always loved you
You always had a lot of style
I’d hate to see you on the pile
Of nearly-made-its
You’ve got the essence, dear
If I could have a second skin
I’d probably dress up in you

You’re a star now, I am fixing people’s nails
I’m knitting jumpers, I’m working after hours
I’ve got a boyfriend, I’ve got a feeling
That he’s seeing someone else
He always had a thing for you as well

Blow in the face of my rivals
I swear and I rant, I make quite an arrival
The men are surprised by the language
They act so discreet, they are hypocrites, forget them
So fuck them too!"

From way far across the sea
Came an Eritrean maiden she
Had a one-track mind and eyes for me
Half blinded in a war
With a pale, young Anglican
Who said he'd help her all he can
Showed her Jesus and his little unholy friend
She had no mind to please him
Just say 'ta-ra' and leave him behind

[Verse 2]
A little boy in a stairwell who
Says 'I hate people like you'
I got matchsticks and cable TV
Half of less than 50P
We all clambered over the balcony
Banging on the window, waking Steve
Bringing with the true love his unholy friend
Singing, 'If you really need it
You just won't leave it behind'

[Chorus]
So baby please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
But don't bring that ghost 'round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore
Please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
Just don't bang on about yesterday
You know I wouldn't know about that anyway

[Verse 3]
Monkey asked to the mouse before
If she loved anybody more than he
Turns you into stone
Now I'm reversing down the lonely street
Cheap hotel where I can meet the past
Pay it off and keep it sweet
(aw) It's sweet and it's nothing, no
It's just like nothing at all

[Verse 4]
You know I've seen you there
How could I help but stare?
It rips the heart out of your baby
I've taken too far too much to see or think or touch what's real
Stranded on this street that paved my only way home
If you really need it all
You just won't leave him behind

[Chorus]
Oh please kill me
Oh no don't kill me
Don't bring that ghost 'round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore
Please kill me
Oh no don't kill me
And don't try joke about yesterday
You know I wouldn't know about that anyway

Hey, are you lonely?
Summer gone so slowly
We found the ground
And that damage was done
It's cold as you fade into the sun
Where'd you go? To me?

But you're alive!
Well, it's only
Fallen frames, they told me
You stand out, it's so loud
And so what if it is?
It's cold as you face into the wind
Where'd it go to? Tonight the sun shall see its light

[Chorus]
So what if you catch me
Where would we land?
In somebody's life
For taking his hands
Sing to me hope as she's thrown on the sand
All of our work is raided again
Where to go?

[Verse 2]
And you were somehow the rain this thing could allow
I tried but it's all wrong
You're so strong
And this life and work
And choice took far too long
Where'd it go? Tonight the sun shall see its light

[Chorus]
So what if you catch me
Where would we land?
In somebody's life
For taking his hands
Sing to me hope as she's thrown on the sand
All of our work is raided again


When I was sure you'd follow through
My world was turned to blue (so thin)
When you'd hide your songs would die
So I'd hide yours with mine
And all my words were bound to fail
I know you won't fail
See, I can tell"

(One, two, three)

[Verse 1]
You've been alone
You've been afraid
I've been a fool in so many ways
But I would change my life if you thought you might try to love me
So please give me another chance to write you another song And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

[Verse 2]
I'm not a saint
I'm just a man who had heaven and Earth in the palm of his hand
But I threw it away
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness
And if you could just please give me another chance to write you another song
And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

[Verse 3]
Little girl, you're all I've got
Don't you leave me standing here once again
'Cause I'll give you my life
Yes, I would, if you would let me try to love you
So please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

No, no, no
You know I love you

I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

From the moment the lights went off
Everything had changed
Lie awake in an empty room
In my head it all feels the same
Like the taste of the day you left
That still lingers on my breath
And the dampness of tears that left
A stain where you had wept
All alone with the negligee
That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead

And there’s no way I’m giving up, oh

And I’m eating home alone on a Friday night

Please, remember me happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin, the time when
We counted every black car passing
Your house beneath the hill
And up until someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention

[Verse 2]
But please, remember me fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say
That the pearly gates
Had some eloquent graffiti
Like ""We'll meet again"" and ""Fuck the man""
And ""Tell my mother not to worry""
And angels with their great handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry

[Verse 3]
And please, remember me that Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white
By midnight, we'd forgotten one another
And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city

[Verse 4]
So please, remember me mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Calling passers-by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour
Gleam and resonate, just like the gates
Around the holy kingdom
With words like ""Lost and found"" and ""Don't look down""
And ""Someone save temptation""

[Verse 5]
And please, remember me as in the dream
We had as rug-burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies
That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior

[Verse 6]
But please, remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above their running
In circles around the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright, on cinder gray, in spray paint
""Who the hell can see forever?""

[Verse 7]
And please, remember me seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turned from me
And said, ""The trapeze act was wonderful
But never meant to last"", the clown that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger

[Verse 8]
So please, remember me finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the pearly gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing
Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissing on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around a frightened trapeze swinger"

Oh, your face I can see and it's desperately kind
But what's at the back of your mind?
Two icy-cold hands conducting the way
It's the Eskimo blood in my veins
Amid concrete and clay and general decay
Nature must still find a way
So, ignore all the codes of the day
Let your juvenile impulses sway
This way and that way, this way, that way
God, how sex implores you
To let yourself lose yourself

Stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait

As we lie, you say
As we lie, you say
Stretch out
Stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
Let your puny body lie down, lie down

As we lie, you say
Will the world end in the night time?
I really don't know
Or will the world end in the day time?
I really don't know
And is there any point ever having children?
Oh, I don't know
All I do know is we're here and it's now

So, stretch out and wait, stretch out and wait
There is no debate, no debate, no debate
How can you consciously contemplate
When there's no debate, no debate?

Happy hands and your elbow
In the appropriate place

Happy plans, for that delicate look
Upon your face

Our bodies moved and hardened
Hurting parts of your garden
With no room for a pardon
In a place where no one knows
What we have done

Do you come
Together ever with him?
And is he dark enough
Enough to see your light?
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?

Well, you held me like a lover
Sweaty hands, and my foot
In the appropriate place

And we use cushions to cover
Happy glands in the mild issue
Of our disgrace

Our minds pressed and guarded
While our flesh disregarded
The lack of space for the light-hearted
In the boom that beats our drum

I know I make you cry
And I know sometimes you wanna die
But do you really feel alive without me?
If so, be free
If not, leave him for me
Before one of us has
Accidental babies
For we are in love

To try to get you thinking they really care

Take the pain of protecting your name
From the crutch to the cane to the highwire

The drifters one has a short life

Worse when I am sleeping

I walked by your apartment twice today
While you were gone at work
And all the colors got so down
It's not as cold out here

Rain that makes the flowers bloom
Rain to leave you all alone

And wishes washed away

You wanted me to write you letters, but I'd rather lose your address
And forget that we'd ever met and what did or did not occur
Sitting in the station, it's all a blur
Of dancehall hips, pretentious quips
A boxer's bob and weave

And here's the kicker of this whole shebang
You're in debt and completely fooled
That you can look into the mirror and objectively rank your wounds
Sewing circles are not solely based in trades of cloth
There's spinsters all around here taking notes, reporting on us

As our days are crawling by so slowly

And hold like the breeze
Half as tight as both eyes closed

Who's seen Jezebel?
She went walking where the cedars line the road
Her blouse on the ground
Where the dogs were hungry, roaming

Saying, ""wait, we swear
We'll love you more and wholly
Jezebel, it's we, we that you are for
Only""

Who's seen Jezebel?
She was born to be the woman we could blame
Make me a beast half as brave
I'd be the same

Who's seen Jezebel?
She was gone before I ever got to say
""Lay here my love
You're the only shape I'll pray to, Jezebel""

Who's seen Jezebel?
Will the mountain last as long as I can wait
Wait like the dawn
How it aches to meet the day

Who's seen Jezebel?
She was certainly the spark for all I've done
The window was wide
She could see the dogs come running

Saying, ""wait, we swear
We'll love you more and wholly

Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know I just love her so
She's my little woman waiting across town
Baby, I'm a little fool for you girl"

While you and me we hold and lean
Onto bodies slick and charged
Together just one beating heart

An ally while I catch your breath

Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Oh dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the wedding now, oh dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

1260,261,Mad About You,Sting,235,The Best Of,,"A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you

And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer?
How much longer?

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you

And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories, without love

A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And through a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you

And though you hold the keys to ruin
Of everything I see
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you"

When the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place

When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall but I give you it all

And I was not well
But I could not help myself

In the morning
You were leaving
Travelling south again
And you said you were not unprepared

And all the dead ends
And disappointments
Were fading from your memory
Ready for that lonely life to end

And you gave me love
When I could not love myself
And you made me turn
From the way I saw myself

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

[Chorus]
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me
Mmmm

'Cause baby, you’re worth it

Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d

[Chorus 1: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
Say something loving
I just don't remember the thrill of affection
I just don't remember
Say something loving
I need a reminder, the feeling's escaped me

[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
I went looking for it
Could have been anyone's kiss
Throwing my arms at no one
When I gave up, I found love

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim]
The thought flows through my mind
And it's growing all the time
I do myself a disservice
To feel this weak, to be this nervous

[Chorus 2: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
You say something loving
It's so overwhelming, the thrill of affection
Feels so unfamiliar
You say something loving
Without hesitation it hits me, hits me
It feels so unfamiliar

Your touch stays on my skin
I feel it start sinking in
Here come my insecurities
I almost expect you to leave

Were you really looking for me?
Try your best to reassure me
I wasn't patient to meet you
Am I too needy, am I too eager?

Say it
Did you hear me say?

Is only getting stronger
I say something loving
All my hesitations are fading, fading
I feel it taking over

Cigarettes and chocolate milk
These are just a couple of my cravings
Everything it seems I like's a little bit stronger
A little bit thicker, a little bit harmful for me

If I should buy jellybeans
Have to eat them all in just one sitting
Everything it seems I like's a little bit sweeter
A little bit fatter, a little bit harmful for me

And then there's those other things
Which for several reasons we won't mention
Everything about 'em is a little bit stranger
A little bit harder, a little bit deadly

It isn't very smart
Tends to make one part
So brokenhearted

Sitting here remembering me
Always been a shoe made for the city
Go ahead accuse me of just singing about places
Where scrappy boys faces have general run of the town

[Verse 5]
Playing with prodigal sons
Takes a lot of sentimental valiums
Can't expect the world to be your Raggedy Andy
While running on empty, you little old doll with a frown

You got to keep in the game
Retaining mystique while facing forward
I suggest a reading of A Lesson in Tightropes
Or Surfing Your High hopes, or Adios Kansas

It isn't very smart
Tends to make one part
So brokenhearted

And here we go, there's nothing left to lose

Where I felt your fire and a sweet release
There's a fire in these hills, that's coming now

When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

When marimba start to play
Hold me close, make me sway
Like a ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me"

1328,329,Wrapped Up in Books,Belle and Sebastian,0,Books,2003-10-06,"It was pretty bright, up on the rainbow bridge tonight
I could see into your window although you’re far away
You were racing in a car
Beside a boy, you just don’t know if he is up for
What you have in mind
If he is up for what you have in mind

Change is on the cards, but this time it will be hard
But I never want to leave you
We’ve never had a fight
You should never split a pole
You should never split at all
I wish I had two paths I could follow
I’d write the ending without any sorrow

I will say a prayer, just while you are sitting there
I will wrap my hands around you
So I know it will be fine

We’ve got a fantasy affair
We didn’t get wet, we didn’t dare
Our aspirations are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks

Summer’s hastening on
I’m trying to get a feeling from
The city but I’ve been unfaithful
I’ve been traveling abroad

We’ve got a fantasy affair
We didn’t get wet, we didn’t dare
But the fantasy remains
You better come back to Earth again
Our aspirations are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks"

I can barely survive
A night in my mind
So I've got a plan
I'm going to find out just how boring I am
And have a good time

Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't they remind you of just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess

Trying not to find

Done with the old me

Never going to find the perfect rhyme

You need not to cross the sea
You need not to find a cure
For everything that makes you weak

You need not to reach for the stars
When life becomes so dark
And when the wind does blow against the grain
You must follow your heart

You must follow your heart

When all your friends have come and gone
And the sun no longer shines
And the happiness for which you long
Is washed away like an oceans tide

When all the hard times outweigh the good
And all your words are misunderstood
When the day seems lost from the start
You must follow your heart

You must follow your heart

If you feel you've paid the price
And your wounds should cease to heal
And everything you love in life
Spins like a winding wheel

If you should wake to find you're abandoned
And the road you traveled leads to a dead end
When death creeps in to play it's part
You must follow your heart

You must follow your heart"

Something happened for the first time
Deep inside, it was a rush, what a rush
'Cause the possibility
That you would ever feel the same way about me
Just too much, just too much

Why do I keep running from the truth?
All I ever think about is you
You got me hypnotized, so mesmerized
And I just got to know

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?
Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?
Do you catch a breath when I look at you?
Are you holding back like the way I do?
Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away-ay-ay
Going away-ay-ay

[Verse 2]
Has it ever crossed your mind
When we're hanging, spending time girl
Are we just friends? Is there more, is there more?
See it's a chance we've gotta take
Cause I believe that we can make this into
Something that will last, last forever, forever

Do you ever think when you're all alone
All that we can be, where this thing can go?

At last, you are complete
But he's distant and you found him
On the phone pleading, saying
""Baby, I love you, and I'll leave her

On each other to the end
The space between us has disappeared

So many great days in a row
Barefoot on Bishopsgate
Trying to find Blake's grave
If we could stay like this in a silver foil
Trapped in amber for a life
Permanent midnight

Is a bore, is a bore?
Who said it, my love? I don't mind it
Anymore, anymore
And I reach out a hand over your side of the bed
Pull that blanket over your shoulders exposed to the night
And the hunger of those early years will never return
But I don't mind, I don't mind
Cause I love my mind when I'm fucking you
Slowed down to a crawl
Years of crime and the bread line
Have not at all dimmed your shine

Let's stay in, let the TV be our stars

All the bright lights do is bore me
They bore me

And how she vowed me, she could bring it back

So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

[Verse 3]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus 3]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"

I drove up to the city at night
And found the place where you grew up
And then where you stayed
And then we walked around and stayed up late
Under city lights; and I spent the night
Next to you in the house where you grew up
Next to you, I miraculously woke up
In your parents' house I lied in bed with you

[Chorus]
I went back to feel alone there
I went back to wipe it clean
I took the lights and radio towers out of my dreams

[Verse 2]
And we went all the way up to the small town where I'm from
With foggy air and the wind and the mountain tops
And we clung to rocks and we looked off
You held my hand, you almost got to start feeling me
I finally felt like I was breathing free
And under swaying trees, we fell asleep and had the same dream
The stars were bright, we dream the same every night
On my island home I spent some time with you

[Chorus]
I went back to feel alone there
I went back there by myself
And gave up on everything that we'd felt

[Verse 3]
We found a precious place in the sand
Right out in the wind, and we lied under a blanket
And heard the furious sound
The roar of waves, the pounding surf
Two bodies on the earth
It was intense just getting to be there next to you
And you were trying to get me then
And I was happy to let you in

[Chorus]
I went back and wished I hadn't
I went back and felt regret
I went to the beach and I stared west

[Verse 4]
Every night when the sun went down
In the town where we live, the empty streets were lit up
By reflective light from a distant sun
Bouncing off a glowing ball of rock
We just lied on the roof and watched
The moon, the moon, the blue light of the moon
We didn't talk and silently we both felt powerful
Like the moon, my chest was full
Because we both knew we're just floating in space
Over molten rock, and we felt safe and discovered that our skin is soft
There's nothing left except certain death
And that was comforting at night out under the moon

[Chorus]
I went out last night to forget that
I went out and stared it down
But the moon just stared back at me
And in its light I saw my two feet on the ground"

If there is a man about town: it is he
If there is one to be sought: it is he
If there are nine she's: they are bought for me

This way is as is she

On top of the family tree

And if he has chosen the point while she is under him
Then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
For it is I
With her on knee

Leave it be, for he controls what there'll be

I saw it glitter as I grew
And loved it boy, I never knew

Wash it all away and make me clean, for you

All dressed in pastel

Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

Take me out
Fuck me up
Steal my records
Screw all my friends

With a smile on your face
And then do it again

So I could make up my mind
Try it for sleeping instead
Maybe you'll rest sometime

They've been knockin' me out lately

Time will take them away
But these feelings won't go away
These feelings won't go away

It ain't easy
For these thoughts here to leave me
There are no words to describe it
In French or in English
'Cause diamonds they fade
And flowers they bloom
And I'm telling you

That these feelings won't go away

It's ink that lies
The pen, the prose, the paper
I live, I learn
You will always take what I have earned
And so aid my end while I believe I'm winning

Our friends speak out in our defense
Pay ten deaf ears for two months rent
We burn the gallows they erect
And cut the nooses they tie for our necks

[Chorus]
You constantly make it impossible to make conversation
Keep us comatose but audible
And I like it the farther I get out
We pass it off but it's all on us
Only common conversation
It took everything I got
And I like it the farther I get out

Once said, always said
I will hold the past over your head
I'll speak my mind whenever I feel slighted
I am hellbent on extracting all of my revenge
Take heart, sweetheart, or I will take it from you

I slip concealed back to the keep
Concede to do the work for free
We prey as wolves among the sheep
And slit the necks of soldiers while they sleep

When life leaves you high and dry
I'll be at your door tonight
If you need help, if you need help
I'll shut down the city lights
I'll lie, cheat, I'll beg and bribe

To make you well, to make you well

[Verse 2]
When enemies are at your door
I'll carry you away from war
If you need help, if you need help
Your hope dangling by a string
I'll share in your suffering
To make you well, to make you well

[Bridge]
Give me reasons to believe
That you would do the same for me

[Chorus]
And I will do it for you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone, gone, gone

[Verse 3]
When you fall like a statue
I'm gon' be there to catch you
Put you on your feet, you on your feet
And if your well is empty
Not a thing will prevent me
Tell me what you need, what do you need

[Pre Chorus]
I surrender honestly
You've always done the same for me

[Chorus]
So I will do it for you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
And long after you're gone, gone, gone

You're my backbone
You're my cornerstone
You're my crutch when my legs stop moving
You're my head start
You're my rugged heart
You're the pulse that I've always needed
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum, baby, don't stop beating
Like a drum my heart never stops beating

For you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
Baby, I'm not moving on
I'll love you long after you're gone
For you, for you
You will never sleep alone
I'll love you long

How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights
How many lies, how many fights
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
""Love is pain,"" I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

[Chorus 1]
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero, sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
Starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across
Started up a brand new day

[Verse 2]
It could happen to you - just like it happened to me
There's simply no immunity - there's no guarantee
I say love's such a force - if you find yourself in it
And sometimes no reflection is there
Baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute

[Chorus 2]
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I’ll sell the stock, we’ll spend all the money
We’re starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, Mac
I begging her to take me back
I’m thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river’s wide, we’ll swim across
Started up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, buddy
Don’t wanna be no fuddy-duddy
Started up a brand new day

[Bridge 1]
I'm the rhythm in your tune
I'm the sun and you're the moon
I'm a bat and you're the cave
You're the beach and I'm the wave
I’m the plow and you’re the land
You're the glove and I'm the hand
I'm the train and you're the station
I'm a flagpole to your nation - yeah

[Bridge 2]
I’m the present to your future
You’re the wound and I’m the suture
You’re the magnet to my pole
I’m the devil in your soul
You’re the pupil, I’m the teacher
You’re the church and I’m the preacher
You’re the flower, I’m the rain
You’re the tunnel, I’m the train

[Outro]
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Starting up a brand new day

[Bridge 3]
You’re the crop to my rotation
You’re the sum of my equation
I’m the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
We’ll go up instead of down
You’re the stair and I’m the handle
You’re the flame and I’m the candle

Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
We're starting up a brand new day
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day"

Sing, muse, of the warning by the whistle
On a night so dark in the waning
A dawn obscured by slate sky raining

Five and twenty burglars by the reservoir
A teenage lookout on the signal tower
The mogul's daughter in hogtie
The mogul fingers the wrong guy, all lies

It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect crime
It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect crime

The bagman's quaking at the fingers
The hand-off glance a little lingers
A well-dressed man in the crosshairs
A shot rings out from somewhere upstairs

It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the
Perfect crime
It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the
Perfect crime

It was the perfect crime

It was like a ticker-tape parade
When the plastique on the safe was blown away
And we all gazed from eye to eye
As we mouthed our silent goodbyes

The valley's sleeping like a bastard
It stinks of slumber and disaster
Two words are spoken on the tap wire
The agent's ploy finds a surefire backfire

It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the
Perfect crime
It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect crime"

But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why d’you have to be so good?

Whenever you hold me
There’s some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running
But just keep it comin’

Walks through the garden rows with her bare feet, laughing
I never learned to count my blessings
I choose instead to dwell in my disasters
I walk on down the hill
Through grass, grown tall and brown
And still its hard somehow to let go of my pain
On past the busted back of that old and rusted Cadillac
That sinks into this field, collecting rain
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged

And of these cut-throat busted sunsets
These cold and damp white mornings
I have grown weary
If through my cracked and dusted dime-store lips
I spoke these words out loud would no one hear me?
Lay your blouse across the chair
Let fall the flowers from from your hair
And kiss me with that country mouth, so plain
Outside, the rain is tapping on the leaves
To me it sounds like they're applauding us the the quiet love we made
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged

Well I looked my demons in the eyes
Laid bare my chest, said ""Do your best, destroy me
You see, I've been to hell and back so many times
I must admit you kind of bore me.""
There's a lot of things that can kill a man
There's a lot of ways to die
Listen, some already did that walked beside me
There's a lot of things I don't understand
Why so many people lie
Its the hurt I hide that fuels the fire inside me
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged"

No, it’s just some guy she's been hanging out with
I don’t know, the past couple weeks I guess""
Well, thank you and hang up the phone
Let the funeral start, hear the casket close
Let’s pin split-black ribbon to your overcoat
Well, laughter pours from under doors
In this house, I don’t understand that sound no more
It seems artificial, like a TV set

Well, haligh, haligh, a lie, haligh
This weight it must be satisfied
You offer only one reply
You know not what you do
But you tear and tear your hair from roots
From that same head you have twice removed now
A lock of hair you said would prove
Our love would never die
Well, ha ha ha

I remember everything
The words we spoke on freezing South Street
And all those mornings watching you get ready for school
You combed your hair inside that mirror
The one you painted blue and glued with jewelry tears
Something about those bright colors
Would always make you feel better
But now we speak with ruined tongues
And the words we say aren’t meant for anyone
It’s just a mumbled sentence to a passing acquaintance
But there was once you

You said you hate my suffering
And you understood
And you’d take care of me
You'd always be there
Well where are you now?

But left to hang like yarn and twine
Dangling before my eyes
As you tear and tear your hair from roots
From that same head you have twice removed now
A lock of hair you said would prove
Our love would never die

And I sing and sing of awful things
The pleasure that my sadness brings
As my fingers press onto the strings
In yet another clumsy chord
Haligh, haligh, an awful lie
This weight will now be satisfied
I'm gonna give you only one reply
I know not who I am

But I talk in the mirror
To the stranger that appears
Our conversations are circles
Always one sided
Nothing is clear

Except we keep coming back
To this meaning that I lack

Now you must live them
Or just not live

Welcome back
Winter once again
And put on your warm fuzzy sweater
Because you'll feel much better when
The snowflakes fall
Gently to the ground
The temperature drops
And your shivers freeze all the rivers around
But I keep you warm

If speed's a pro
Inertia must be a con
Because the cold wind blows at precise rates
When I've got my ice skates on
If all the roads
Were paved with ice that wouldn't thaw or crack
I could skate from Maine to Nebraska
Then on to Alaska and back
Because you keep me warm

Peer over the edge
Can you see me?
Rivulets flow from your eyes
Paint runs from your mouth
Like a waterfall
And your lungs crystalize
I'll travel the sub-zero tundra
I'll brave glaciers and frozen lakes
And that's just the tip of the iceberg
I'll do whatever it takes
To change

Farewell powdery paradise
We'd rather skate on the thinnest ice
Fingers failed us before they froze
Frostbite bit down on all our toes

Snow drifts build up and enfold us
As we wait out this winter storm
So we snuggle close in the darkness
And keep each other so warm"

Likewise if uncertainty puts a spell on me, I have to zoom in your laughter, your laughter
Wednesday morning, we sleep over and we're late again
Let's skip breakfast, we need this precious time just to comprehend

I'm all about you, you're all about me, we're all about each other
I'm all about you, you're all about me, we're all about each other
I'm all about you, you're all about me, we're all about each other

I sailed a wild, wild sea
Climbed up a tall, tall mountain
I met an old, old man
Beneath a weeping willow tree
He said, ""Now if you got some questions
Go and lay them at my feet
But my time here is brief
So you'll have to pick just three""

[Verse 2]
And I said, ""What do you do
With the pieces of a broken heart?
And how can a man like me
Remain in the light?
And if life is really as short as they say
Then why is the night so long?""
And then the sun went down
And he sang for me this song

See, I once was a young fool like you
Afraid to do the things that I knew I had to do
So I played an escapade, just like you

So you'll have to pick just three""

And there have been some that I have broken

That all the stupid things, the things I always do
This time with you, I always knew

[Bridge]
I need someone
To be close, when at night
My own demonds
Slick under my pillow
Want someone that comes and goes forever
I need you here
Stay and show me love

You don't need me, you just want me)"
1478,479,It's All Coming Back to Me Now,Céline Dion,0,Falling Into You,1996-07-29,"[Verse 1]
There were nights when the wind was so cold
That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

[Chorus]
But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that
I just have to admit
That it's all coming back to me
When I touch you like this
And I hold you like that
It's so hard to believe but
It's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 2]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things I'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than any laws allow
Baby, baby

[Chorus]
If I kiss you like this
And if you whisper like that
It was lost long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you want me like this
And if you need me like that
It was dead long ago
But it's all coming back to me
It's so hard to resist
And it's all coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now
But it's all coming back

[Verse 3]
There were those empty threats and hollow lies
And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

[Chorus]
But if I touch you like this
And if you kiss me like that
It was so long ago
But it's all coming back to me
If you touch me like this
And if I kiss you like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)

[Verse 4]
There were moments of gold
And there were flashes of light
There were things we'd never do again
But then they'd always seemed right
There were nights of endless pleasure
It was more than all your laws allow
Baby, baby, baby

[Chorus]
When you touch me like this
And when you hold me like that
It was gone with the wind
But it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
Then we see what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall
But it's all coming back to me now

[Chorus]
If you forgive me all this
If I forgive you all that
We forgive and forget
And it's all coming back to me
When you see me like this
And when I see you like that
We see just what we want to see
All coming back to me
The flesh and the fantasies
All coming back to me
I can barely recall, but it's all coming back to me now

It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love

Love is ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

It will be completely

Lover, will you look at me now?
I'm already dead to you
But I'm inclined to explain
What I could not before

Whatever you didn't do, what you couldn't say
I am sorry the worst has arrived
For I deserve more
For at least I deserve the respect of a kiss goodbye

Tell me, do you think of me now
As I think of you?
For I could not have shaken
The touch of your breath on my arm

For it has stayed in me as an epithet
I am sorry the worst has arrived
For I'm on the floor
In the room where we made it our last touch of the night

[Chorus]
I walked, cause you walked
But I won't probably get very far
Sensation to what you said
But I'm not about to expect something more

I would not have run off
But I couldn't bear that it's me, it's my fault
I should not be so lost
But I've got nothing left to love

[Verse 2]
Lover, will you look from me now
I'm already dead
But I've come to explain
Why I left such a mess on the floor

For when you went away I went crazy
I was wild with the breast of a dog
I ran through the night
With a knife in my chest, with the lust of your loveless life

I walked, cause you walked
But I won't probably get very far

To run through my veins, like disease, disease

With cabin fever, shut in confined spaces
Lost in the dark, my heart taken and resting on your heart

To run through my veins, like disease, disease
And now we are strange, strangers

Wait for me to degrade before
You go killing prey for waste of
Daylight speaks when
Slumber's keeping under the bed
Out of revenge, I'm derailing
My youth has stained our sheets
With some piece of me
With some piece of me

Oh, winter come
Oh, winter crush all of the things that I once loved
Winter come
Winter crush all of the things that I once had"

And find me on yours

My heart ticks in beat with these kids that I grew up with

Where we come from
And where we call home

Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back

They'll say it's not worth it
So we'll leave this town in ruins

I know the social lies
Move anti
Focus when I vocalise
Countdown when seek beats
The weak know to hide
I can't choose days to show my pride

So it’s fist in the air, when I hold the mic
Rather be the outkast or the prototype
Can't conform to the filters & pose for hype
They teeth from top charts thats an overbite, Like

…Too many celebrities overnight
Insta careers, over in a moments sight
Gassed from number but your followers move like poltergeist
Pointless pursuing images if your soul ain't right

I can't mix with those energies there
Leviate clear from an enemies stare
Next year I’ll be a better me swear
But I'm here with truth I could never be dare

Cause I , level the vessel in me
Boil like kettles, from instrumentals
Little me never picked pettles
But patterned the rules, to rebel

Revel being the bomb
With Jäger & Red Bull
Technique is immortal
But still I never dance with the devil

Settle your decimals
Dependable on other man writing
You don’t need a pen at all
Defeated book a pedicure

…I see the issues then address it like pinafore
Win-doe's opportunities like there’s never bin a door

1 flow, 2 flow, 3 flows, fro'z
Only chill by realness kept it fro'z
I tried to share the mic but they fro'z
Big the gyal dem flex with fro'z (x4)

VERSE 2

Yeah they followed with their pen skills
I lead with pencils
Permanent drive, their stuck with rentals
You know that a black queen is essential
Don’t chat about weakest link
When you’re not linked in-
Checked your LinkedIn
Where’s the credentials?

No CV like you're not a Cov residential
Even if I didn’t live in B23
The corrupt still don’t want you to be too free

See the downfall is locked to your mental
I can’t support all the violence they fed you
Can’t support all the standards that tempt you
Never attempted to fit in, just spin riddims to vent to

Cut ties with questioning when
Make moves, not wise to enter the den
Enter with dragons, flagging fire prepared to offended
With a heart full of anger, But mindful of zen

Pre-Chorus

If you can’t take the heat get out the kitchen
If you can’t take the cold adapt your system (x4)

Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling

You're wasting your time, I'm not buying

You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be

She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

Can't you tell, this is Austin

No one to see on the quay no one waving
For me just the shoreline receding
Ticket in my hand, I'm thinking ""wish I didn't hand it in""

Leaving behind all the faces that I might
Replace if I tried on that long ride
Looking deep inside but I don't want to look so deep inside yet

Sit down, sit down on the prow to wave bye
There might not be another star further on the line
Look out, look out at each town that glides by
And there's another crowd to drown in crying eyes

And see how that light you love now just won't shine
There might just be another star that's high and far in some other sky

Real enough yet to step off of that set
To decide what her hands might be doing?
Ruining the play, to in the ensuing melee escape""

The ship's deck now sags from the weight of our tracks
As we pace beneath flags black and battered
Rattling our swords in service of some faded foreign lord

The maps he sent to us don't mention lost coastlines

And I must have looked like a ghost cause something frightened me
And since then I've been so good at vanishing

Now I do as I please and lie through my teeth
Someone might get hurt, but it won't be me
I should probably feel cheap but I just feel free...
And a little bit empty
No, it isn't so hard to get close to me
There will be no arguments
We will always agree
And I'll try and be kind when I ask you to leave

Her heels so high, and my hopes so low
Because I don't know how to love

And if she likes, I'll tell her lies
How we'll be in love by the morning
I don't think she knows
That I'm saying good bye

Sweet surprise, I could get used to
Unusual you

Been so many things when I was someone else
Boxer in the ring, tryna defend myself
And the private eye to see what's going on
That's long gone

Shocking, 'cause I never knew love like this could exist

You'll never let me down
Answer my call, here after all
Never met anyone like you

Say a prayer to the man above
Thank him for everything you know
You should thank him for every breath you blow

If you find yourself caught in love
Say a prayer to the man above
You should thank him for every day you pass
Thank him for saving your sorry ass

If you're single, but looking out
You must raise your prayer to a shout
Another partner must be found
Someone to take your life beyond
Another TV ""I Love 1999""
Just one more box of cheapo wine

If you find yourself caught in love
You should say a prayer to the man above

If you don't listen to the voices then my friend
You'll soon run out of choices
What a pity it would be
You talk of freedom don't you see
The only freedom that you'll ever really know
Is written in books from long ago
Give up your will to Him that loves you
Things will change, I'm not saying overnight
But something has to give
You're too good looking not to live

If you find yourself out of love
Shed a tear for the one you love
Tell your boss that you've gone away
Down your tools for a holiday
If you're going off to war then I wish you well
But don't be sore
If I cheer the other team
Killing people's not my scene
I prefer to give the inhabitants a say
Before you blow their town away
I like to watch them play
I like to marvel at the random beauty of a simple village girl
Why should she be the one who's killed?

If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love"

And I'll take the vow and seal a pact

But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way
Tonight

And some days I pray for Silence
And some days I pray for Soul

Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it!

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love!
And you know it's true and thats a fact
I would do anything for love!
And there'll never be no turning back

But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long
So long

And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love

No. No, I won't do that!

And in return, she'll get my support

About the world we live in and life in general

She'll hear me out and won't easily be converted
To my way of thinking, in fact, she'll often disagree
But at the end of it all, she will understand me

With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things in a different light

But when I'm asleep I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly

Just lace up your shoes while I'm fetching a sleeping bag, a tent...

A walk on sand, a fire I can warm my hands

I'm never short of new inspiration

Made my plans to conquer the country

I guess I should take Prozac, right

I could leave this agony behind
Which is just what I'd do
If I wanted to

I could listen to my therapist
Pretend you don't exist
And not have to dream of what I dream of
I could listen to all my friends
And go out again
And pretend it's enough
Or I could make a career of being blue
I could dress in black and read Camus
Smoke clove cigarettes and drink vermouth
Like I was 17

I turn to you and I let you know that I Love You

Her love it nursed him back to life

Even if its alone.""

But tell me something, can they see mine?

And have all the signs of a bleeding heart

Living high on a giant hog
On a mountain so steep
Keep your head in a hollow log
As the ruling fog are about to creep

What have we done?
How'd we get so far from the sun?
Lost, lost in an oscillating phase
Where a tiny few catch all of the rays

Out beyond the western squalls
In an alien land
They work for nothing at all
They don't know the mall or the layaway plan

Dig yourself a beautiful grave
Everything you could want
Maybe those invisible slaves
Are too far away for a ghost to haunt

What will we charge?
Letting go of a claim so large
Oh, all of our working days are done
But a tiny few are having all of the fun

Get used to the dust in your lungs

Is there no way down
From this peak to solid ground
Without having our gold teeth
Pulled from our mouths?

Make me a drink strong enough
To wash away the dishwater world they said was lemonade
Walk with me after the show
Maybe we can find a way through the minefield in the snow

Letting go of a claim so large

Falling down under the pale moonlight
You were holding to me
Like a someone broken
And I couldn't tell you but I'm telling you now

Just let me hold you while you're falling apart
Just let me hold you and we'll both fall down

Fall on me, tell me, everything you want me to be
Forever with you, forever in me, ever the same

We would stand in the wind
We were free like water
Flowing down
Under the warmth of the sun
Now it's cold and we're scared
And we've both been shaken
Yeah, look at us man
This doesn't need to be the end

Just let me hold you while you're falling apart
Just let me hold you and we'll both fall down

Fall on me, tell me, everything you want me to be
Forever with you, forever in me, ever the same
Call on me
And I'll be there for you and you'll be there for me
Forever it's you, forever in me, ever the same

You may need me there
To carry all your weight
But you're no burden I assure
You tide me over
With a warmth I'll not forget
But I can only give you love

Fall on me, tell me, everything you want me to be
Forever with you, forever in me, ever the same

Has her world outside it
Scrabbles in the earth with her fingers and her mouth
She's five years old

Threads worms on a string
Keeps spiders in her pocket
Collects fly wings in a jar
Scrubs horse flies
And pinches them on a line
Ohhh...!

She has one friend, he lives next door
They're listening to the weather
He knows how many freckles she's got
She scratches his beard

She's painting huge books
And glues them together
They saw a big raven
It glided down the sky
She touched it
Ohh...!

Today is her birthday
They're smoking cigars
He's got a chain of flowers
And sews a bird in her knickers
Ohhh...!

They're smoking cigars
They lie in the bathtub

She's taking her time, making up the reasons
To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles
And the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one

They're saying
""Mama never loved her much
And Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away
From human affection.""
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting
For the right kind of pilot to come (And she'll say to him...)

I would fly to the moon and back
If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world
Where we belong
So would you be my baby?

She can't remember a time
When she felt needed
If love was red then she was color blind
All her friends, they've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined

She's saying
""Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith
Is, is like a journey
I just don't have a map for.""

So, baby's gonna take a dive
And push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging
All her hopes on the stars (What a pleasant dream...)

With the focus I gave to my birthday candles
I've wished on the lidded blue flames under your brow
And, baby, I wished for you

And I wanna crawl in with you but I cry instead
I want your warm but it will only make me colder when it's over
So I can't tonight, baby

If I need you, I'll just use your simple name
Only kisses on the cheek from now on

The path is clear to follow through
I stood too long in the way of the door
And now I'm giving up on

What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us

That it's over

And you're restless
And I'm naked

You can't stand to see me shaking
No, could you let me go

And you don't want to be here in the future
So you say
The present's just a pleasant
Interruption to the past
And you don't want to look much closer
Cause you're afraid to find out all the hope
That you had sent into the sky by now had... crashed
And it did because of me

And then you bring me home
Afraid to find out that you're alone, no
And I'm sleeping in your living room
But we don't have much room
To live

And I had dreams that I would learn to play guitar
Maybe cross the country
Become a rockstar
And there was hope in me
That I could take you there
But dammit you're so young
But I don't think I care
And if I hurt you then I'm sorry

Was touch her long blond hair

    I should wish to place upon record here our gratitude to all our friends upon the Amazon for the very great kindness and hospitality which was shown to us upon our return journey. Very particularly would I thank Senhor Penalosa and other officials of the Brazilian Government for the special arrangements by which we were helped upon our way, and Senhor Pereira of Para, to whose forethought we owe the complete outfit for a decent appearance in the civilized world which we found ready for us at that town. It seemed a poor return for all the courtesy which we encountered that we should deceive our hosts and benefactors, but under the circumstances we had really no alternative, and I hereby tell them that they will only waste their time and their money if they attempt to follow upon our traces. Even the names have been altered in our accounts, and I am very sure that no one, from the most careful study of them, could come within a thousand miles of our unknown land.

    The excitement which had been caused through those parts of South America which we had to traverse was imagined by us to be purely local, and I can assure our friends in England that we had no notion of the uproar which the mere rumor of our experiences had caused through Europe. It was not until the Ivernia was within five hundred miles of Southampton that the wireless messages from paper after paper and agency after agency, offering huge prices for a short return message as to our actual results, showed us how strained was the attention not only of the scientific world but of the general public. It was agreed among us, however, that no definite statement should be given to the Press until we had met the members of the Zoological Institute, since as delegates it was our clear duty to give our first report to the body from which we had received our commission of investigation. Thus, although we found Southampton full of Pressmen, we absolutely refused to give any information, which had the natural effect of focussing public attention upon the meeting which was advertised for the evening of November 7th. For this gathering, the Zoological Hall which had been the scene of the inception of our task was found to be far too small, and it was only in the Queen's Hall in Regent Street that accommodation could be found. It is now common knowledge the promoters might have ventured upon the Albert Hall and still found their space too scanty.

    It was for the second evening after our arrival that the great meeting had been fixed. For the first, we had each, no doubt, our own pressing personal affairs to absorb us. Of mine I cannot yet speak. It may be that as it stands further from me I may think of it, and even speak of it, with less emotion. I have shown the reader in the beginning of this narrative where lay the springs of my action. It is but right, perhaps, that I should carry on the tale and show also the results. And yet the day may come when I would not have it otherwise. At least I have been driven forth to take part in a wondrous adventure, and I cannot but be thankful to the force that drove me.

    And now I turn to the last supreme eventful moment of our adventure. As I was racking my brain as to how I should best describe it, my eyes fell upon the issue of my own Journal for the morning of the 8th of November with the full and excellent account of my friend and fellow-reporter Macdona. What can I do better than transcribe his narrative—head-lines and all? I admit that the paper was exuberant in the matter, out of compliment to its own enterprise in sending a correspondent, but the other great dailies were hardly less full in their account. Thus, then, friend Mac in his report:

                                                THE NEW WORLD
                            GREAT MEETING AT THE QUEEN'S HALL
                                            SCENES OF UPROAR
                                    EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENT
                                                WHAT WAS IT?
                            NOCTURNAL RIOT IN REGENT STREET
                                                         (Special)

    ""The much-discussed meeting of the Zoological Institute, convened to hear the report of the Committee of Investigation sent out last year to South America to test the assertions made by Professor Challenger as to the continued existence of prehistoric life upon that Continent, was held last night in the greater Queen's Hall, and it is safe to say that it is likely to be a red letter date in the history of Science, for the proceedings were of so remarkable and sensational a character that no one present is ever likely to forget them."" (Oh, brother scribe Macdona, what a monstrous opening sentence!) ""The tickets were theoretically confined to members and their friends, but the latter is an elastic term, and long before eight o'clock, the hour fixed for the commencement of the proceedings, all parts of the Great Hall were tightly packed. The general public, however, which most unreasonably entertained a grievance at having been excluded, stormed the doors at a quarter to eight, after a prolonged melee in which several people were injured, including Inspector Scoble of H. Division, whose leg was unfortunately broken. After this unwarrantable invasion, which not only filled every passage, but even intruded upon the space set apart for the Press, it is estimated that nearly five thousand people awaited the arrival of the travelers. When they eventually appeared, they took their places in the front of a platform which already contained all the leading scientific men, not only of this country, but of France and of Germany. Sweden was also represented, in the person of Professor Sergius, the famous Zoologist of the University of Upsala. The entrance of the four heroes of the occasion was the signal for a remarkable demonstration of welcome, the whole audience rising and cheering for some minutes. An acute observer might, however, have detected some signs of dissent amid the applause, and gathered that the proceedings were likely to become more lively than harmonious. It may safely be prophesied, however, that no one could have foreseen the extraordinary turn which they were actually to take.

    ""Of the appearance of the four wanderers little need be said, since their photographs have for some time been appearing in all the papers. They bear few traces of the hardships which they are said to have undergone. Professor Challenger's beard may be more shaggy, Professor Summerlee's features more ascetic, Lord John Roxton's figure more gaunt, and all three may be burned to a darker tint than when they left our shores, but each appeared to be in most excellent health. As to our own representative, the well-known athlete and international Rugby football player, E. D. Malone, he looks trained to a hair, and as he surveyed the crowd a smile of good-humored contentment pervaded his honest but homely face."" (All right, Mac, wait till I get you alone!)

    ""When quiet had been restored and the audience resumed their seats after the ovation which they had given to the travelers, the chairman, the Duke of Durham, addressed the meeting. 'He would not,' he said, 'stand for more than a moment between that vast assembly and the treat which lay before them. It was not for him to anticipate what Professor Summerlee, who was the spokesman of the committee, had to say to them, but it was common rumor that their expedition had been crowned by extraordinary success.' (Applause.) 'Apparently the age of romance was not dead, and there was common ground upon which the wildest imaginings of the novelist could meet the actual scientific investigations of the searcher for truth. He would only add, before he sat down, that he rejoiced—and all of them would rejoice—that these gentlemen had returned safe and sound from their difficult and dangerous task, for it cannot be denied that any disaster to such an expedition would have inflicted a well-nigh irreparable loss to the cause of Zoological science.' (Great applause, in which Professor Challenger was observed to join.)

    ""Professor Summerlee's rising was the signal for another extraordinary outbreak of enthusiasm, which broke out again at intervals throughout his address. That address will not be given in extenso in these columns, for the reason that a full account of the whole adventures of the expedition is being published as a supplement from the pen of our own special correspondent. Some general indications will therefore suffice. Having described the genesis of their journey, and paid a handsome tribute to his friend Professor Challenger, coupled with an apology for the incredulity with which his assertions, now fully vindicated, had been received, he gave the actual course of their journey, carefully withholding such information as would aid the public in any attempt to locate this remarkable plateau. Having described, in general terms, their course from the main river up to the time that they actually reached the base of the cliffs, he enthralled his hearers by his account of the difficulties encountered by the expedition in their repeated attempts to mount them, and finally described how they succeeded in their desperate endeavors, which cost the lives of their two devoted half-breed servants."" (This amazing reading of the affair was the result of Summerlee's endeavors to avoid raising any questionable matter at the meeting.)

    ""Having conducted his audience in fancy to the summit, and marooned them there by reason of the fall of their bridge, the Professor proceeded to describe both the horrors and the attractions of that remarkable land. Of personal adventures he said little, but laid stress upon the rich harvest reaped by Science in the observations of the wonderful beast, bird, insect, and plant life of the plateau. Peculiarly rich in the coleoptera and in the lepidoptera, forty-six new species of the one and ninety-four of the other had been secured in the course of a few weeks. It was, however, in the larger animals, and especially in the larger animals supposed to have been long extinct, that the interest of the public was naturally centered. Of these he was able to give a goodly list, but had little doubt that it would be largely extended when the place had been more thoroughly investigated. He and his companions had seen at least a dozen creatures, most of them at a distance, which corresponded with nothing at present known to Science. These would in time be duly classified and examined. He instanced a snake, the cast skin of which, deep purple in color, was fifty-one feet in length, and mentioned a white creature, supposed to be mammalian, which gave forth well-marked phosphorescence in the darkness; also a large black moth, the bite of which was supposed by the Indians to be highly poisonous. Setting aside these entirely new forms of life, the plateau was very rich in known prehistoric forms, dating back in some cases to early Jurassic times. Among these he mentioned the gigantic and grotesque stegosaurus, seen once by Mr. Malone at a drinking-place by the lake, and drawn in the sketch-book of that adventurous American who had first penetrated this unknown world. He described also the iguanodon and the pterodactyl—two of the first of the wonders which they had encountered. He then thrilled the assembly by some account of the terrible carnivorous dinosaurs, which had on more than one occasion pursued members of the party, and which were the most formidable of all the creatures which they had encountered. Thence he passed to the huge and ferocious bird, the phororachus, and to the great elk which still roams upon this upland. It was not, however, until he sketched the mysteries of the central lake that the full interest and enthusiasm of the audience were aroused. One had to pinch oneself to be sure that one was awake as one heard this sane and practical Professor in cold measured tones describing the monstrous three-eyed fish-lizards and the huge water-snakes which inhabit this enchanted sheet of water. Next he touched upon the Indians, and upon the extraordinary colony of anthropoid apes, which might be looked upon as an advance upon the pithecanthropus of Java, and as coming therefore nearer than any known form to that hypothetical creation, the missing link. Finally he described, amongst some merriment, the ingenious but highly dangerous aeronautic invention of Professor Challenger, and wound up a most memorable address by an account of the methods by which the committee did at last find their way back to civilization.

    ""It had been hoped that the proceedings would end there, and that a vote of thanks and congratulation, moved by Professor Sergius, of Upsala University, would be duly seconded and carried; but it was soon evident that the course of events was not destined to flow so smoothly. Symptoms of opposition had been evident from time to time during the evening, and now Dr. James Illingworth, of Edinburgh, rose in the center of the hall. Dr. Illingworth asked whether an amendment should not be taken before a resolution.

    ""THE CHAIRMAN: 'Yes, sir, if there must be an amendment.'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH: 'Your Grace, there must be an amendment.'

    ""THE CHAIRMAN: 'Then let us take it at once.'

    ""PROFESSOR SUMMERLEE (springing to his feet): 'Might I explain, your Grace, that this man is my personal enemy ever since our controversy in the Quarterly Journal of Science as to the true nature of Bathybius?'

    ""THE CHAIRMAN: 'I fear I cannot go into personal matters. Proceed.'

    ""Dr. Illingworth was imperfectly heard in part of his remarks on account of the strenuous opposition of the friends of the explorers. Some attempts were also made to pull him down. Being a man of enormous physique, however, and possessed of a very powerful voice, he dominated the tumult and succeeded in finishing his speech. It was clear, from the moment of his rising, that he had a number of friends and sympathizers in the hall, though they formed a minority in the audience. The attitude of the greater part of the public might be described as one of attentive neutrality.

    ""Dr. Illingworth began his remarks by expressing his high appreciation of the scientific work both of Professor Challenger and of Professor Summerlee. He much regretted that any personal bias should have been read into his remarks, which were entirely dictated by his desire for scientific truth. His position, in fact, was substantially the same as that taken up by Professor Summerlee at the last meeting. At that last meeting Professor Challenger had made certain assertions which had been queried by his colleague. Now this colleague came forward himself with the same assertions and expected them to remain unquestioned. Was this reasonable? ('Yes,' 'No,' and prolonged interruption, during which Professor Challenger was heard from the Press box to ask leave from the chairman to put Dr. Illingworth into the street.) A year ago one man said certain things. Now four men said other and more startling ones. Was this to constitute a final proof where the matters in question were of the most revolutionary and incredible character? There had been recent examples of travelers arriving from the unknown with certain tales which had been too readily accepted. Was the London Zoological Institute to place itself in this position? He admitted that the members of the committee were men of character. But human nature was very complex. Even Professors might be misled by the desire for notoriety. Like moths, we all love best to flutter in the light. Heavy-game shots liked to be in a position to cap the tales of their rivals, and journalists were not averse from sensational coups, even when imagination had to aid fact in the process. Each member of the committee had his own motive for making the most of his results. ('Shame! shame!') He had no desire to be offensive. ('You are!' and interruption.) The corroboration of these wondrous tales was really of the most slender description. What did it amount to? Some photographs. {Was it possible that in this age of ingenious manipulation photographs could be accepted as evidence?} What more? We have a story of a flight and a descent by ropes which precluded the production of larger specimens. It was ingenious, but not convincing. It was understood that Lord John Roxton claimed to have the skull of a phororachus. He could only say that he would like to see that skull.

    ""LORD JOHN ROXTON: 'Is this fellow calling me a liar?' (Uproar.)

    ""THE CHAIRMAN: 'Order! order! Dr. Illingworth, I must direct you to bring your remarks to a conclusion and to move your amendment.'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH: 'Your Grace, I have more to say, but I bow to your ruling. I move, then, that, while Professor Summerlee be thanked for his interesting address, the whole matter shall be regarded as 'non-proven,' and shall be referred back to a larger, and possibly more reliable Committee of Investigation.'

    ""It is difficult to describe the confusion caused by this amendment. A large section of the audience expressed their indignation at such a slur upon the travelers by noisy shouts of dissent and cries of, 'Don't put it!' 'Withdraw!' 'Turn him out!' On the other hand, the malcontents—and it cannot be denied that they were fairly numerous—cheered for the amendment, with cries of 'Order!' 'Chair!' and 'Fair play!' A scuffle broke out in the back benches, and blows were freely exchanged among the medical students who crowded that part of the hall. It was only the moderating influence of the presence of large numbers of ladies which prevented an absolute riot. Suddenly, however, there was a pause, a hush, and then complete silence. Professor Challenger was on his feet. His appearance and manner are peculiarly arresting, and as he raised his hand for order the whole audience settled down expectantly to give him a hearing.

    ""'It will be within the recollection of many present,' said Professor Challenger, 'that similar foolish and unmannerly scenes marked the last meeting at which I have been able to address them. On that occasion Professor Summerlee was the chief offender, and though he is now chastened and contrite, the matter could not be entirely forgotten. I have heard to-night similar, but even more offensive, sentiments from the person who has just sat down, and though it is a conscious effort of self-effacement to come down to that person's mental level, I will endeavor to do so, in order to allay any reasonable doubt which could possibly exist in the minds of anyone.' (Laughter and interruption.) 'I need not remind this audience that, though Professor Summerlee, as the head of the Committee of Investigation, has been put up to speak to-night, still it is I who am the real prime mover in this business, and that it is mainly to me that any successful result must be ascribed. I have safely conducted these three gentlemen to the spot mentioned, and I have, as you have heard, convinced them of the accuracy of my previous account. We had hoped that we should find upon our return that no one was so dense as to dispute our joint conclusions. Warned, however, by my previous experience, I have not come without such proofs as may convince a reasonable man. As explained by Professor Summerlee, our cameras have been tampered with by the ape-men when they ransacked our camp, and most of our negatives ruined.' (Jeers, laughter, and 'Tell us another!' from the back.) 'I have mentioned the ape-men, and I cannot forbear from saying that some of the sounds which now meet my ears bring back most vividly to my recollection my experiences with those interesting creatures.' (Laughter.) 'In spite of the destruction of so many invaluable negatives, there still remains in our collection a certain number of corroborative photographs showing the conditions of life upon the plateau. Did they accuse them of having forged these photographs?' (A voice, 'Yes,' and considerable interruption which ended in several men being put out of the hall.) 'The negatives were open to the inspection of experts. But what other evidence had they? Under the conditions of their escape it was naturally impossible to bring a large amount of baggage, but they had rescued Professor Summerlee's collections of butterflies and beetles, containing many new species. Was this not evidence?' (Several voices, 'No.') 'Who said no?'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH (rising): 'Our point is that such a collection might have been made in other places than a prehistoric plateau.' (Applause.)

    ""PROFESSOR CHALLENGER: 'No doubt, sir, we have to bow to your scientific authority, although I must admit that the name is unfamiliar. Passing, then, both the photographs and the entomological collection, I come to the varied and accurate information which we bring with us upon points which have never before been elucidated. For example, upon the domestic habits of the pterodactyl—'(A voice: 'Bosh,' and uproar)—'I say, that upon the domestic habits of the pterodactyl we can throw a flood of light. I can exhibit to you from my portfolio a picture of that creature taken from life which would convince you——'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH: 'No picture could convince us of anything.'

    ""PROFESSOR CHALLENGER: 'You would require to see the thing itself?'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH: 'Undoubtedly.'

    ""PROFESSOR CHALLENGER: 'And you would accept that?'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH (laughing): 'Beyond a doubt.'

    ""It was at this point that the sensation of the evening arose—a sensation so dramatic that it can never have been paralleled in the history of scientific gatherings. Professor Challenger raised his hand in the air as a signal, and at once our colleague, Mr. E. D. Malone, was observed to rise and to make his way to the back of the platform. An instant later he re-appeared in company of a gigantic negro, the two of them bearing between them a large square packing-case. It was evidently of great weight, and was slowly carried forward and placed in front of the Professor's chair. All sound had hushed in the audience and everyone was absorbed in the spectacle before them. Professor Challenger drew off the top of the case, which formed a sliding lid. Peering down into the box he snapped his fingers several times and was heard from the Press seat to say, 'Come, then, pretty, pretty!' in a coaxing voice. An instant later, with a scratching, rattling sound, a most horrible and loathsome creature appeared from below and perched itself upon the side of the case. Even the unexpected fall of the Duke of Durham into the orchestra, which occurred at this moment, could not distract the petrified attention of the vast audience. The face of the creature was like the wildest gargoyle that the imagination of a mad medieval builder could have conceived. It was malicious, horrible, with two small red eyes as bright as points of burning coal. Its long, savage mouth, which was held half-open, was full of a double row of shark-like teeth. Its shoulders were humped, and round them were draped what appeared to be a faded gray shawl. It was the devil of our childhood in person. There was a turmoil in the audience—someone screamed, two ladies in the front row fell senseless from their chairs, and there was a general movement upon the platform to follow their chairman into the orchestra. For a moment there was danger of a general panic. Professor Challenger threw up his hands to still the commotion, but the movement alarmed the creature beside him. Its strange shawl suddenly unfurled, spread, and fluttered as a pair of leathery wings. Its owner grabbed at its legs, but too late to hold it. It had sprung from the perch and was circling slowly round the Queen's Hall with a dry, leathery flapping of its ten-foot wings, while a putrid and insidious odor pervaded the room. The cries of the people in the galleries, who were alarmed at the near approach of those glowing eyes and that murderous beak, excited the creature to a frenzy. Faster and faster it flew, beating against walls and chandeliers in a blind frenzy of alarm. 'The window! For heaven's sake shut that window!' roared the Professor from the platform, dancing and wringing his hands in an agony of apprehension. Alas, his warning was too late! In a moment the creature, beating and bumping along the wall like a huge moth within a gas-shade, came upon the opening, squeezed its hideous bulk through it, and was gone. Professor Challenger fell back into his chair with his face buried in his hands, while the audience gave one long, deep sigh of relief as they realized that the incident was over.

    ""Then—oh! how shall one describe what took place then—when the full exuberance of the majority and the full reaction of the minority united to make one great wave of enthusiasm, which rolled from the back of the hall, gathering volume as it came, swept over the orchestra, submerged the platform, and carried the four heroes away upon its crest?"" (Good for you, Mac!) ""If the audience had done less than justice, surely it made ample amends. Every one was on his feet. Every one was moving, shouting, gesticulating. A dense crowd of cheering men were round the four travelers. 'Up with them! up with them!' cried a hundred voices. In a moment four figures shot up above the crowd. In vain they strove to break loose. They were held in their lofty places of honor. It would have been hard to let them down if it had been wished, so dense was the crowd around them. 'Regent Street! Regent Street!' sounded the voices. There was a swirl in the packed multitude, and a slow current, bearing the four upon their shoulders, made for the door. Out in the street the scene was extraordinary. An assemblage of not less than a hundred thousand people was waiting. The close-packed throng extended from the other side of the Langham Hotel to Oxford Circus. A roar of acclamation greeted the four adventurers as they appeared, high above the heads of the people, under the vivid electric lamps outside the hall. 'A procession! A procession!' was the cry. In a dense phalanx, blocking the streets from side to side, the crowd set forth, taking the route of Regent Street, Pall Mall, St. James's Street, and Piccadilly. The whole central traffic of London was held up, and many collisions were reported between the demonstrators upon the one side and the police and taxi-cabmen upon the other. Finally, it was not until after midnight that the four travelers were released at the entrance to Lord John Roxton's chambers in the Albany, and that the exuberant crowd, having sung 'They are Jolly Good Fellows' in chorus, concluded their program with 'God Save the King.' So ended one of the most remarkable evenings that London has seen for a considerable time.""

    So far my friend Macdona; and it may be taken as a fairly accurate, if florid, account of the proceedings. As to the main incident, it was a bewildering surprise to the audience, but not, I need hardly say, to us. The reader will remember how I met Lord John Roxton upon the very occasion when, in his protective crinoline, he had gone to bring the ""Devil's chick"" as he called it, for Professor Challenger. I have hinted also at the trouble which the Professor's baggage gave us when we left the plateau, and had I described our voyage I might have said a good deal of the worry we had to coax with putrid fish the appetite of our filthy companion. If I have not said much about it before, it was, of course, that the Professor's earnest desire was that no possible rumor of the unanswerable argument which we carried should be allowed to leak out until the moment came when his enemies were to be confuted.

    One word as to the fate of the London pterodactyl. Nothing can be said to be certain upon this point. There is the evidence of two frightened women that it perched upon the roof of the Queen's Hall and remained there like a diabolical statue for some hours. The next day it came out in the evening papers that Private Miles, of the Coldstream Guards, on duty outside Marlborough House, had deserted his post without leave, and was therefore courtmartialed. Private Miles' account, that he dropped his rifle and took to his heels down the Mall because on looking up he had suddenly seen the devil between him and the moon, was not accepted by the Court, and yet it may have a direct bearing upon the point at issue. The only other evidence which I can adduce is from the log of the SS. Friesland, a Dutch-American liner, which asserts that at nine next morning, Start Point being at the time ten miles upon their starboard quarter, they were passed by something between a flying goat and a monstrous bat, which was heading at a prodigious pace south and west. If its homing instinct led it upon the right line, there can be no doubt that somewhere out in the wastes of the Atlantic the last European pterodactyl found its end.

    And Gladys—oh, my Gladys!—Gladys of the mystic lake, now to be re-named the Central, for never shall she have immortality through me. Did I not always see some hard fiber in her nature? Did I not, even at the time when I was proud to obey her behest, feel that it was surely a poor love which could drive a lover to his death or the danger of it? Did I not, in my truest thoughts, always recurring and always dismissed, see past the beauty of the face, and, peering into the soul, discern the twin shadows of selfishness and of fickleness glooming at the back of it? Did she love the heroic and the spectacular for its own noble sake, or was it for the glory which might, without effort or sacrifice, be reflected upon herself? Or are these thoughts the vain wisdom which comes after the event? It was the shock of my life. For a moment it had turned me to a cynic. But already, as I write, a week has passed, and we have had our momentous interview with Lord John Roxton and—well, perhaps things might be worse.

    Let me tell it in a few words. No letter or telegram had come to me at Southampton, and I reached the little villa at Streatham about ten o'clock that night in a fever of alarm. Was she dead or alive? Where were all my nightly dreams of the open arms, the smiling face, the words of praise for her man who had risked his life to humor her whim? Already I was down from the high peaks and standing flat-footed upon earth. Yet some good reasons given might still lift me to the clouds once more. I rushed down the garden path, hammered at the door, heard the voice of Gladys within, pushed past the staring maid, and strode into the sitting-room. She was seated in a low settee under the shaded standard lamp by the piano. In three steps I was across the room and had both her hands in mine.

    ""Gladys!"" I cried, ""Gladys!""

    She looked up with amazement in her face. She was altered in some subtle way. The expression of her eyes, the hard upward stare, the set of the lips, was new to me. She drew back her hands.

    ""What do you mean?"" she said.

    ""Gladys!"" I cried. ""What is the matter? You are my Gladys, are you not—little Gladys Hungerton?""

    ""No,"" said she, ""I am Gladys Potts. Let me introduce you to my husband.""

    How absurd life is! I found myself mechanically bowing and shaking hands with a little ginger-haired man who was coiled up in the deep arm-chair which had once been sacred to my own use. We bobbed and grinned in front of each other.

    ""Father lets us stay here. We are getting our house ready,"" said Gladys.

    ""Oh, yes,"" said I.

    ""You didn't get my letter at Para, then?""

    ""No, I got no letter.""

    ""Oh, what a pity! It would have made all clear.""

    ""It is quite clear,"" said I.

    ""I've told William all about you,"" said she. ""We have no secrets. I am so sorry about it. But it couldn't have been so very deep, could it, if you could go off to the other end of the world and leave me here alone. You're not crabby, are you?""

    ""No, no, not at all. I think I'll go.""

    ""Have some refreshment,"" said the little man, and he added, in a confidential way, ""It's always like this, ain't it? And must be unless you had polygamy, only the other way round; you understand."" He laughed like an idiot, while I made for the door.

    I was through it, when a sudden fantastic impulse came upon me, and I went back to my successful rival, who looked nervously at the electric push.

    ""Will you answer a question?"" I asked.

    ""Well, within reason,"" said he.

    ""How did you do it? Have you searched for hidden treasure, or discovered a pole, or done time on a pirate, or flown the Channel, or what? Where is the glamour of romance? How did you get it?""

    He stared at me with a hopeless expression upon his vacuous, good-natured, scrubby little face.

    ""Don't you think all this is a little too personal?"" he said.

    ""Well, just one question,"" I cried. ""What are you? What is your profession?""

    ""I am a solicitor's clerk,"" said he. ""Second man at Johnson and Merivale's, 41 Chancery Lane.""

    ""Good-night!"" said I, and vanished, like all disconsolate and broken-hearted heroes, into the darkness, with grief and rage and laughter all simmering within me like a boiling pot.

    One more little scene, and I have done. Last night we all supped at Lord John Roxton's rooms, and sitting together afterwards we smoked in good comradeship and talked our adventures over. It was strange under these altered surroundings to see the old, well-known faces and figures. There was Challenger, with his smile of condescension, his drooping eyelids, his intolerant eyes, his aggressive beard, his huge chest, swelling and puffing as he laid down the law to Summerlee. And Summerlee, too, there he was with his short briar between his thin moustache and his gray goat's-beard, his worn face protruded in eager debate as he queried all Challenger's propositions. Finally, there was our host, with his rugged, eagle face, and his cold, blue, glacier eyes with always a shimmer of devilment and of humor down in the depths of them. Such is the last picture of them that I have carried away.

    It was after supper, in his own sanctum—the room of the pink radiance and the innumerable trophies—that Lord John Roxton had something to say to us. From a cupboard he had brought an old cigar-box, and this he laid before him on the table.

    ""There's one thing,"" said he, ""that maybe I should have spoken about before this, but I wanted to know a little more clearly where I was. No use to raise hopes and let them down again. But it's facts, not hopes, with us now. You may remember that day we found the pterodactyl rookery in the swamp—what? Well, somethin' in the lie of the land took my notice. Perhaps it has escaped you, so I will tell you. It was a volcanic vent full of blue clay."" The Professors nodded.

    ""Well, now, in the whole world I've only had to do with one place that was a volcanic vent of blue clay. That was the great De Beers Diamond Mine of Kimberley—what? So you see I got diamonds into my head. I rigged up a contraption to hold off those stinking beasts, and I spent a happy day there with a spud. This is what I got.""

    He opened his cigar-box, and tilting it over he poured about twenty or thirty rough stones, varying from the size of beans to that of chestnuts, on the table.

    ""Perhaps you think I should have told you then. Well, so I should, only I know there are a lot of traps for the unwary, and that stones may be of any size and yet of little value where color and consistency are clean off. Therefore, I brought them back, and on the first day at home I took one round to Spink's, and asked him to have it roughly cut and valued.""

    He took a pill-box from his pocket, and spilled out of it a beautiful glittering diamond, one of the finest stones that I have ever seen.

    ""There's the result,"" said he. ""He prices the lot at a minimum of two hundred thousand pounds. Of course it is fair shares between us. I won't hear of anythin' else. Well, Challenger, what will you do with your fifty thousand?""

    ""If you really persist in your generous view,"" said the Professor, ""I should found a private museum, which has long been one of my dreams.""

    ""And you, Summerlee?""

    ""I would retire from teaching, and so find time for my final classification of the chalk fossils.""

    ""I'll use my own,"" said Lord John Roxton, ""in fitting a well-formed expedition and having another look at the dear old plateau. As to you, young fellah, you, of course, will spend yours in gettin' married.""

    ""Not just yet,"" said I, with a rueful smile. ""I think, if you will have me, that I would rather go with you.""

    Lord Roxton said nothing, but a brown hand was stretched out to me across the table."

Now I've got to ask you one more thing
Keep doing that forever

Fifth time in your bedroom

And you leaned upon your elbow
And began to speak to me

Spackled some butter over my whole grain bread
Something tastes different, maybe it's my tongue
Something tastes different, suddenly I'm not so young

Don't be a fool girl, tell him you love him
Don't be a fool girl, you're not above him

Now I know I can't love anyone but you
You make me think that maybe I won't die alone

But little do they know, I'm just a maybe
Maybe my baby will be the one to leave me sore
Maybe my baby will settle the score

What have I become
Something soft and really quite dumb
Because I've fallen, oh
Cause I've fall-fallen
Oh, cause I've fall-fall-fallen
So far away from the place where I started from

I never thought I could love anyone
I never thought I could love anyone

Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe, I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do

And I almost brought him up

About the movies that your family watches
Every single Christmas, and I will talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

To bury secrets in

And you've early closed your curtain
I'll wait by the backstage door

The lines to speak your mind
And pry it open, hoping for an encore
And if it gets too late, for me to wait
For you to find you love me, and tell me so

Ancient as the stone
Blacked out on a bicycle

I swear that you don't have to go
I thought we could wait for the fireworks
I thought we could wait for the snow
To wash over Georgia and kill the hurt
I thought I could live in your arms
And spend every moment I had with you
Stay up all night with the stars
Confess all the faith that I had in you (I had in you)

[Pre-Chorus]
Too late, I'm sure and lonely
Another night, another dream wasted on you
Just be here now against me
You know the words, so sing along for me, baby

[Chorus]
For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
But you won't stop crying
This anniversary may never be the same
Inside I hope you know I'm dying
With my heart beside me
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
And if I died right now you'd never be the same

[Verse 2]
I thought with a month of apart
Together would find us an opening
And moonlight would provide the spark
And that I would stumble across the key
Or break down the door to your heart
Forever could see us - not you and me
And you'd help me out of the dark
And I'd give my heart as an offering (an offering)

[Pre-Chorus]
Too late, I'm sure and lonely
Another night, another dream wasted on you
Just be here now against me
You know the words, so sing along for me, baby

For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
But you won't stop crying
This anniversary may never be the same
Inside I hope you know I'm dying
With my heart beside me
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
And if I died right now you'd never be the same

And I will always remember you as you are right now to me
And I will always remember you now, remember you now

So sleep alone tonight, with no one here just by your side
Sleep alone tonight

How does he feel, how does he kiss?
(Let's sleep alone tonight)
How does he taste while he's on your lips?
(With no one here just by your side)
How does he feel, how does he kiss?

I can't forget you
(Let's sleep alone tonight)
I know you want me to want you, I want to

But I can't forget you

So when this is over don't blow your composure, baby
I can't forget you

I must look just like a fool here
In the middle of the road
Standing there in your rear view
And getting soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
The glow of a brake light

Down the road ahead

You ain't showed it yet
I keep a looking for
The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown

I held on longer than I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time

Come on tap those brakes

I write you visions of my summer
It was the best I ever had
There were choruses and sing-alongs
And that unspoken feeling
Of knowing that right now is all that matters

All the nights we stayed up talking
Listening to '80s songs
And quoting lines from all those movies that we love
It still brings a smile to my face

I guess when it comes down to it
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right

Breaking into hotel swimming pools
And wreaking havoc on our world
Hanging out at truck stops just to pass the time
The blacktop singing me to sleep

Lighting fireworks in parking lots
Illuminate the blackest nights
Cherry cokes under this moonlit summer sky
2015 Riverside, it's time to say goodbye

Get on the bus, it's time to go
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right

(Get it right)

Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right"

Still a little bit delirious

I’ve seen love go by my door
It’s never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
I've been shooting in the dark too long
When something’s not right, it’s wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 2]
Dragon clouds so high above
I’ve only known careless love
It always just hit me from below
But this time 'round it’s more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry, if you don’t know
Can’t remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoilin’ me too much, love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time

Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud
But there’s no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Bridge 2]
You're gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to

I’ll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco or Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know

In the tall grass, in the ones I love

I will replace the noise with silence instead
Flushing out your head

If you like it violent
We can play rough and tumble
Fall into bed
And I won't breathe so you can recover

When you're in pieces
Just follow the echo of my voice
It's okay
Tune into that frequency

Don't fight your reflex
Embrace the instinct
You can feel your way
Through the burden we face in the end

Cause it breaks my heart
That we live this way
I know people need love
Them people never play the game
And we talk the talk
We communicate
Them people need love
Those people never play the game

Pleasure for pleasure
It eases consequence
And love for a fall
But I know you love to take the risk

The past is weakness
Don't beg the question when the answer is war
There are moments when I'm overcome

Cause it breaks my heart
That we live this way
I know people need love
Cause them people never play the game
And we talk the talk
We communicate
Them people need love
Those people never play the game

And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
People need love"

As I walk this land of broken dreams
I have visions of many things
But happiness is just an illusion
Filled with sadness and confusion

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Maybe

The roots of love grow all around
But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me

[Verse 4]
I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

Just to find someone to care

I know I'm gonna find a way
Nothing's gonna stop me now
I'll find a way somehow

I think about the time we wasted
I think about the years to come
It's getting late and I can't call
It's getting late to face it all
I think about the time we wasted
My loneliness has slowly grown
I told you not to cross the line

[Pre-Chorus]
And leave me with your love for granted
The letters from your broken heart
I think I might have lost them somewhere

[Chorus]
Don't tell me 'bout your lies
Don't tell me 'bout your secrets

[Verse 2]
My love is easy
You are everything I need
Now your love is gone
I want it safe & guaranteed
Life is such a fine line
Looking at the bright line
I think about the time we wasted
For someday I'll be coming too
Tonight is dying on its own

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I got your love for granted
It doesn’t matter, right or wrong
As long as you are hiding somewhere

[Chorus]
Don't tell me 'bout your lies
Don't tell me 'bout your secrets

[Verse 3]
Even though we've said it all
I would never let us fall with you
Hang on to a little chance, you bet I'm in
If it is for better
Disillusion comes after, it's true
Hang on to a little chance, you bet I'm in

[Verse 3]
Even though we've said it all
I would never let us fall with you
Hang on to a little chance, you bet I'm in
If it is for better
Disillusion comes after, it's true
Hang on to a little chance, you bet I'm in"

Turning circles and time again
Cut like a knife, oh now

Than sweet, sweet lies, oh now

Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul

Sweep me off my feet

1712,713,The No Seatbelt Song,Brand New,269,Your Favorite Weapon,2001-10-09,"So, it's sad this doesn't suit you now
And me fresh out of rope...
Please ignore the lisp, I never meant to sound like this
So take me and break me and make me strong like you
I'll be forever grateful to this and you

It's only you, beautiful
Or I don't want anyone
If I can choose it's only you

Fix me to a chain around your neck and wear me like a nickel
Even new wine served in old skins cheapens the taste
I shot the pilot, now I'm begging you to fly this for me
I'm here for you to use, broken and bruised
Do you understand?

It's only you, beautiful
Or I don't want anyone
If I can choose, it's only you
But how could I miscalculate... perfect eyes will have perfect aim
If I can choose, it's only you

“We're wrecking” and I'm dry like a drum...when you scream
So fine I'll leave... we're spent... we've got time and trials...
Measured in miles... we slave for days (and weeks)

It's only you, beautiful
Or I don't want anyone
If I can choose. It's only you
But how could I miscalculate... perfect lies from a perfect dame
If I can choose... it's only you"

Hold your breath now, it's stacking up
Etched with marks, but I can deal
And you're the problem and you can't feel

Try this on, straightjacket feeling
So maybe I won't be alone
Take back now, my life you're stealing
Yesterday was hell
But today, I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you would be
That face is tearing holes in me again

Trust you is just one defense
Off a list of others, you don't make sense
Beg me time and time again
To take you back now, but you can't win

Run away this time without you

And all the things you put me through
I'm holding on by letting go of you

There will be a better view from here
And only lonesome you remains
And just the thought of you I fear
It falls away

I really want you
I really want you

[Verse 1]
Many prophets preach on bended knee
Many clerics wasted wine
Do the bloody sheets
On those cobbled streets mean
I have wasted time?
Are there silver shores on paradise?
Can I come in from the cold?
I killed a man in a far away land
My enemy I'm told

[Chorus]
I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that
I know you want to know what's right
But I know it's so hard for you to do that
And time's running out as often it does
And often dictates that you can't do that
But fate can't break this feeling inside
That's burning up through my veins
I really want you
I really want you
I really want you now
No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart
I really want you
I really want you

[Verse 2]
Is a poor man rich in solitude?
Or will mother earth complain
Did the beggar pray for a sunny day but
Lady luck for rain
They say a million people bow and scrape
To an effigy of gold
I saw life begin
And the ship we're in
And history unfold

And all my stories have been told?
Will your heart still race for me?
Or will it march to a new beat?

If I was a simple man
I'd own no home, I'd own no land
Would you still stand by my side?
And would our flame still burn so bright?

I'm so full of these endless rhymes
About the way I feel inside
I wish I could just get a ride

If I was a simple man
And I could make you understand
There'd be no reason to think twice
You'd be my sun; you'd be my light

Another cue for you to fold your ears
Another train of thought too hard to follow
Chuggin' along to a song that belongs to the shifting of gears

The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance
To your love
To your love

I would've warned you but really what's the point
Caution could but rarely ever helps
Don't be down, my demeanor tends to disappoint
It's hard enough even trying to be civil to myself

Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance

Dance the rigadoon around you
But by the time I'm close to you
I lose my desideratum and now you

Am I your gal or should I get out of town
I just need to be reassured
Do you just deal it out or can you deal with all that I lay down?

The pain is evident in my existence
Please forgive me for my distance
The shame is manifest in my resistance

Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

Are you gonna kiss me or not?

Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last

Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee

Thinking hopes and lots of dreams that aren't there?
Is it wicked not to care when you've wasted many hours
Talking endlessly to anyone that's there?

I know the truth awaits me
But still I hesitate because of fear

Skipping tickets, making rhymes
Is that all that you believe in?
Wearing rags to make you pretty by design
Rusting armor for effect
Its not fun to watch the rust grow
For it will all be over when you're dead

Counting acts and clutching thoughts
By the river where the moss grows
Over rocks the water running all the time
Is it wicked when you smile even though you feel like crying
Even though you could be sick at any time?

But if there was a sequel
Would you love me as an equal?
Would you love me till I'm dead?

If there was a sequel would you love me like an equal?
Would you love me till I'm dead
And if there was a sequel would you love me as an equal?
Would you love me till I'm dead
Or is there someone else instead?"

I like to believe you are thinking of me
And when the sun comes through your window
I like to believe you’ve been dreaming of me

Dreaming

I know
'Cause I'd spend half this morning
Thinking about the t-shirt you sleep in

I should know
'Cause I'd spend all the whole day
Listening to your message I’m keeping and never deleting

When I saw you
Everyone knew
I liked the effect that you had on my eyes

But no one else heard
The weight of your words
Or felt the effect that they have on my mind

Falling

I know

Thinking about the t-shirt you sleep in

And the chain on my swing is squeaking like a mouse

So are you my lady, are you?
My lady, are you?

You have to climb to find its head
But if there's a glitch
You're an ostrich
You've got your head in the sand

In a submersible I can hardly breathe
As it takes me inside, so the light sings
Answer me truthfully
Do the clouds kiss you?
With meringue-coloured hair
I know they cannot

So, are you my lady, are you?

My lady, are you?
My lady, are you?
The rain is falling down
I could not be seen with you

Zookeeper hear me out
How dare you go?
Cold in the rain

You have to climb to find its head
But if there's a glitch
You're an ostrich
You've got your head in the sand

So many times betrayed
Trying to find an honest word
To find the truth enslaved

I do love, she does heartbreak
I did love till she broke my heart

Doin' all I can do just to be close to you
Every time that we meet, I skip a heartbeat
Always up for a laugh, she's a pain in the arse;
Every time that we meet, I skip a heartbeat

I skip a heartbeat for you

Doin' all I can do just to be close to you
Every time that we meet, I skip a heartbeat
Always up for a laugh, she's a pain in the arse;
Every time that we meet, I skip a heartbeat

I skip a heartbeat for you"

Home, is this a quiet place where you should be alone?
Is this where the tortured and the troubled find their own?
I don't know, but I can tell this isn't you, your cover's blown
Oh no, don't you dare hang up this phone

[Chorus]
HEY!
Give me space so I can breathe
Give me space so I can sleep
Give me space so you can drown in this with me

[Verse 2]
In this place, a lonely escapade in outer space
There's no antidote for irony, you say
That you have when you know that you don't
And you say that you can when you know that you won't

[Chorus]
HEY!
Give me space so I can breathe
Give me space so I can sleep
Give me space so you can drown in this with me

[Chorus 2]
HEY!
Give me space but I can't breathe
Give me space but I can't sleep
Give me just one inch, I swear that's all I need

Sometimes they make me want to scream
AHHHH!

It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell

[Verse 2]
Next day I chased her 'round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote

[Chorus]
""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

[Verse 3]
Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room

[Verse 4]
Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

[Chorus]
""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

Unlucky, I’ve got nowhere to go and so I follow my feet

A choice is facing you, a healthy dose of pain
A choice is facing you as you stare through the rain
A choice is facing you but I choose to refrain for today
Tomorrow we’ll be back in trouble again

Dream one, you had a whole lot of fun with a comedian
Stop short of going all the way, you’ll have to make it someday

Why is this happening to you, you’re not a child?
Why is this happening? You’ve too much on your mind
Things creep up on you when you are fast asleep
You are dreaming, you are sleepy
You are stuck to the sheets

In a town so small there’s no escaping you
In a town so small there’s no escape from view
In a town so small there’s nothing left to do

Dream two you couldn’t see her face but you saw everything else
Dream two was pretty special, easily beats loving yourself

Could you put a name to someone else's sigh?
Could you put a face to someone else's eyes?
Is it someone that you’d maybe recognize?

On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys

Remember how we used to talk
About busting out - we'd break their hearts

Hoping it would never end

Racing cars and being cool
With a six pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go

Remember at the prom that night
You and me we had a fight
But the band they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong

We danced so close
We danced so slow

EXT. WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT - DAY

A crisp and perfect New England town.  Almost too neat
to be real.  No visible townspeople.  CAMERA EXPLORES
town.


CAMERA FLIES

over a rickety bridge -- PAST the Maitland Hardware and
Appliance store -- PAST the church -- the Historical
Society -- UP over the graveyard on the hill and
finally --

To the Maitland house.  The perfect Victorian house
surveying the tiny village.  Suddenly --


A GIANT DADDY LONGLEGS SPIDER

mounts the crest of the hill beside the house, pauses to
wave a spindly leg and then creeps menacingly on top of
the Maitland house.

ADAM (O.S..)
Well, well, you're a big fella...!

A hand -- as big as God's -- with a huge tweezer,
gently reaches down out of the sky and lies, palm up,
in the yard next to the house.  Daddy Longlegs climbs
into it.  The hand rises into the sky again.


INT. ATTIC - NEW ANGLE - DAY

Reveals Winter River as a miniature town, while The
Daddy Longlegs and the hand are normal size.  Above the
model are a homely representation of moon, sun, and
stars -- a whole, tiny, mechanical universe to track
the hours of the day.  A large plat map of the city is
prominent on the wall.

The hand is ADAM MAITLAND'S.  In his late 30's, he's a
solid easy-going citizen.  Capra used to make movies
about him.

Adam's model town sprawls across most of the attic
space.  Windows on either end of the attic shed good
light into the warm room.  Adam very carefully lifts
the spider out the open window.  Smiles as he drips him
lightly on the breeze.


CAMERA TILTS UP FROM THE WINDOW

To see the real Winter River, laid out exactly as the
model, at the foot of the hill.  Adam breathes deeply
and looks very pleased at the glorious town below him.


ON HIS HUGE HAND AGAIN

as it reaches into model and tweezes a tiny sign into
the tiny window of Maitland's Hardware Store on main
street.  It reads:

ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND
ARE
ON VACATION!
HOORAY!

Adam leans down and eyes the sign.

BARBARA
(behind him)
I'm ready!

Adam turns to see entering:  BARBARA MAITLAND, 35 -- a
wholesome beauty who is mellowing well.  She smiles at
him.  Perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her,
because they don't have children.

ADAM
(happy to see her)
She's ready.

BARBARA
(eyeing the model)
It looks great.

ADAM
(nodding)
Thanks.

She pushes a wrapped present across the table.

BARBARA
Happy vacation, honey!

Adam smiles and gives her a present he's hidden under
the table.  He opens his present.  A can of furniture
oil.

ADAM
Manchurian Tung oil?
(playfully grabs
Barbara and kisses
her)
Where did you get it?

BARBARA
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
There's enough to refinish the
gateleg table and the cherry
wardrobe...

Adam hands Barbara a carefully-wrapped bundle -- she
unwraps her gift... rolls of very expensive floral
wallpaper.  She cradles it in her arms like gold leaf.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam... it's beautiful.

Adam nods, and embraces her.

ADAM
Enough to do the guest room...

BARBARA
(cooing)
I'm so glad we're spending our
vacation at home...
(with a sudden resolve)
... I'm going to get started right
now!

ADAM
(pulling her back)
Whoa!... hold on...

Barbara calms down, returning to Adam's embrace... as:

PHONE RINGS -- They freeze, then grin.

ADAM & BARBARA
(unison)
No one's home!

HONK HONK outside.  They look at each other horrified.
Peer out the window.

BARBARA
Oh no.

ADAM
(pointing at her)
It's your turn, darling.

She shakes her head with resignation and goes downstairs.
KNOCKING on door from below.


INT. STAIRCASE AND KITCHEN - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS Adam and Barbara downstairs.  We see the
rambling, old fashioned quality to the house.

Clean, sentimental, warm and floral.  Some rooms in
progress.  They continue down the main staircase past
photos of themselves, old photos of the early days of
Winter River, pictures and mementos of three
generations in hardware.  Barbara goes to the kitchen
and Adam continues down to the basement.


HER POV - A WOMAN

JANE BUTTERFIELD -- tall, gawky and aggressive peeks in
the kitchen door.  She's divorced three husbands and
buried another for good measure.  She's ruthless but is
weirdly, seamlessly pleasant.  She waves a legal sized
paper at them, starts to come inside.


INT./EXT. KITCHEN DOOR

Barbara makes dash for it and holds it just as Jane gets
a foot in.  Jane smiles wildly.

JANE
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you.
I heard you were on vacation!

BARBARA
That's right, Jane.  Complete
vacation.

JANE
Honey -- today I am three hundred
fifty thousand dollars!

BARBARA
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the
morning!

JANE
Look at me, think of me as cash!
This offer is really real!  From a
rich man in New York City who only
saw a photograph!
(rattles on)
My buyer has just made a killing
in condos in Manhattan, but he's
got a little stress problem...
(taps her head)
... so -- he wants to bring the
wife and kid for the old peace and
quiet.

BARBARA
That's what we're looking for,
too.

JANE
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, just
listen now.  This house is too
big.  It really ought to be for a
couple with a family.

That hurts Barbara a little.  She looks at Jane.

JANE
(continuing)
Oh, honey... I didn't mean
anything... it's just too big for
you.

Jane compulsively affixes her business card, face inside.
in the windowpane.

BARBARA
(shutting door)
'Bye, Jane, see you in a few
weeks.


ADAM

is humming happily, looking for paint brushes in the
ground floor storeroom.  He spies a cassette deck and
looks through a stack of cassettes and plays one.  It
is an old INKSPOTS LOVE SONG.


INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

Barbara is starting to paper the walls already.  She
frowns at the MUSIC.  Goes to the door.

BARBARA
Oh, honey.  You said no Inkspots
on this vacation!

It CLICKS OFF.  She goes back into the room.


INT. STOREROOM - DAY

Adam puts away the tape but keeps humming the song.  He
opens the shutters on a small window.  ON WINDOW...

JANE
(her huge face
grinning at him)
Boo!

He jumps back, frightened.

ADAM
No, Jane.

Adam closes the shutters as Jane affixes yet another
card to the window.  He continues his search for a
brush.


JANE

exits jauntily, flapping her contract down the lawn.


INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Adam continues rummaging for a brush.  Can't find it.

ADAM
(calling to distant
Barbara)
Honey, come with me down to the
store?

BARBARA (O.S.)
What for?

ADAM
I need a good brush for this Tung
oil and I want to pick up a piece
of the model.  Let's go early
before anyone sees us.

Barbara has already papered a few rolls in the guest
room.

BARBARA
Okay, but let's hurry back.  You
just run in okay?


EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

The Victorian house from the model ""in the flesh.""
Adam stands by the station wagon.

On the bumper of the car is a sticker reading:
WARNING:  I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS.

Barbara gets in driver's side.  They drive off.


INT. THE CAR - DAY

Adam dusts the inside of the dashboard.  Clean Clean.

BARBARA
(preoccupied)
Jane said we should sell the house
to someone with a family.

ADAM
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.

Puts his hand on her shoulder.


EXT. THE RIVER AND BRIDGE AND HILL - DAY

We see the car coming down the hill toward the bridge.

ADAM (V.O.)
We should be flattered that she
wants to sell our house.

BARBARA (V.O.)
I know... I just wish she'd leave
us alone.

ADAM (V.O.)
Let's not think about it.  We'll
have a nice romantic, quiet,
vacation.  Here comes the bridge
chorus.

Car reaches the rickety covered bridge.  Car shakes,
bobbing up and down on every plank.

ON Barbara and Adam TIGHT -- (they've done this routine
before).  They sing an old Johnny Mathis song.  With a
lot of vibrato.

TOGETHER
Chances are... When I wear a
foolish grin...

They laugh.


EXT. DOWNTOWN WINTER RIVER - DAY

Just like the model, but real.  And populated.

CAMERA PAUSES ON a gorgeous storefront with a brass
lion out front.  Sign above doors says --

BOZMAN BUILDING 1835

An old man polishes the lion as Maitlands drive by and
wave.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Wave at the lion.

ADAM (V.O.)
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

BARBARA (V.O.)
(embarrassed)
Adam!

Ernie looks around to see no one's looking and polishes
the balls of the lion.


CAMERA SPIES A JAUNTY DOG

like Benji, peeing on the opposite corner of the lion.
Maitlands drive by store with sign:

JANE BUTTERFIELD
ANTIQUES
REAL ESTATE
TRAVEL


INT. ANTIQUE STORE REAL ESTATE OFFICE TRAVEL AGENCY -
DAY

The store is bursting with antiques of all sorts,
travel brochures, photographs of houses for sale, and a
serve-yourself Xerox machine.  LITTLE JANE, her eight-
year-old daughter is drudgingly making copies.

Jane, phone in hand, rushes to the window to watch
Maitlands drive by.  Almost popping the cord when it
reaches its end.  She's waiting for the other party to
pick up.

JANE
Y... ello.  Mrs. Deetz?  Well the
condition is what we country folk
call, fixin'... Yes, I think they
are fixin' to accept another
offer.  Well maybe if you offer
390,000 they'll take it.


EXT. MAITLAND HARDWARE - DAY

Adam sprints up the steps of his lovely hardware store.
OLD BILL, a slightly-addled ancient barber, is napping
in a chair in front of his shop, next door to Adam's.
Adam fumbles with the lock, not interested in conver-
sation.  He drops his keys, waking Old Bill.

OLD BILL
'Morning, Adam.  You need a
haircut before your vacation?

ADAM
No thanks, Bill.

OLD BILL
How's the model coming?

ADAM
Good, Bill -- Good.

Bill turns around and continues prattling even though
Adam has entered.  Bill prattles throughout.

OLD BILL
Y'know, I was thinkin'... you said
Bozman built the foundation in
1835 but y'know his grandson came
in here last week and said he
found a bottle with an 1836 stamp
in it plastered in the foundation.
(suddenly disgusted
at the memory)
He's got hair down to his
goddamned shoulders...


INT. MAITLAND HARDWARE

Adam pulls down a few good paintbrushes and carefully
picks up a small model of the Bozman building.  He
walks out.  Old Bill continues unabated.

OLD BILL
He said ""Just give me a trim..."" I
took a scissors to him so fast...
would've skimmed him clean if he
hadn't...

Adam strides by quickly to the car.

ADAM
See you, Bill.

OLD BILL
Right.


EXT. MAITLAND'S CAR - DAY

The Maitlands drive their car out of town.


ON JANE


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE - DAY

Car approaches.


INT. CAR - DAY

Five brushes sit on the seat next to Adam.  He cradles
small replica of the Bozman building, complete with
brass lion.

BARBARA
It's a beauty.

ADAM
Yeah it turned out okay.  We
applied for a historical plaque
for it.  That'll be the third one
on Main Street.

BARBARA
(jokingly)
With all these historical
landmarks in town, where are they
going to put the condominiums?

ADAM
(grinning)
Slow down there, honey... I don't
want the vibration to weaken the
model.

BARBARA
(nervous)
Oh... I'm sorry...

Barbara starts to apply the brakes.

Just before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road.
Stops to pee.  Barbara swerves.  As the car hits the
rickety bridge, the speed is just a bit too much.

Boards RATTLE and loosen, the car skews and catches in
an open slot, careens to the right, then the left and
the bridge.


INT. CAR - DAY

A piling has smashed through the window on the pas-
senger side, crushing the upper part of Barbara's
arm.  She is wailing in pain and fright.

Adam tries to help Barbara.  He tries to get out of the
car.  None of this succeeds.


EXT. BRIDGE AND RIVER - DAY

The dog finishes, looks over at the car, walks across
the bridge and steps on the one board which holds the
car aloft.

The car rocks back and forth for a moment, and then
slides forward toward the water.


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE

The car plunges into the rushing water.  It floats
for a moment, and then sinks like a stone.

FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN:

INT. BARBARA AND ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Quiet, still, expectant.  There is a fire laid in the
hearth.  Suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites
and burns with a furious cheerfulness.

Barbara and Adam enter, dazed, wet, and bedraggled.

BARBARA
Something like this always happens
when we try to go on vacation.
Always.

Adam leads her toward the fire.

ADAM
You'll feel better when you're
dry.

He holds out his hands to be warmed.  Barbara comes up
beside him.  All this time she's been holding her
injured arm with the other hand.

BARBARA
This fire wasn't burning when we
left the house.

ADAM
How's your arm?

BARBARA
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.

She holds her arms out to warm them.  One hand catches
on fire.


BARBARA'S LEFT ARM

They stare at it dumbfoundedly before Adam regains his
senses and snatches it out of the fire.  Two of the
fingers are burning like candles, and Barbara indus-
triously blows them out.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam.

CUT TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM:  A FEW MINUTES LATER - DAY

They are sitting on the couch together.  Barbara is
looking away slightly -- as one does when a doctor is
drawing blood -- while Adam looks at her fingers.  He
frowns.

He looks at his skin.  It is pale.  He looks at
Barbara.

ADAM
You'd better sit down, hon.

BARBARA
I am sitting.

ADAM
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I
don't think we survived that
crash.

BARBARA
(pause)
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own
house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some
coffee.  You get some more
firewood.

Adam gets up, a little absently, she follows him as he
wanders to the front door.  He peers out.

ADAM
Let's take things extra slow.  Do
you remember how we got back up
here?

Barbara tests her hand, clenches and unclenches her
fist.

BARBARA
I'm fine.  My arm works fine.

Adam, exploring, opens the door, steps out on the front
porch.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - TWILIGHT

Adam's face is painted with color of sunset.  He stands
atop the steps leading down to the front yard.  Barbara
stands just inside the open threshold, looking out
worriedly.

BARBARA
(quiet sarcasm)
The end of a perfect day.

Adam starts to step down to the yard.

ADAM
Honey, I'm gonna go down to the
bridge and retrace our steps.

He steps off the last step into the yard and promptly
disappears.

BARBARA
Adam!


EXT. THE GREAT VOID

Adam is nowhere.  There's no ground, no sky, nothing to
stand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance.
Just vast nothing.  Not white and not colored either.
NOISE OF A CLOCK TICKING.

Adam looks about surprised, doesn't like what he
doesn't see.  He turns around to head back up the
steps.  There are no steps.

ADAM
Barbara?

His VOICE ECHOES STRANGELY.  He runs off a little in
the distance, and calls again from over there.

ADAM
(continuing; quietly)
Where are you?

He goes even farther away.


IN THE FOREGROUND

an enormous geared wheel -- the size of a man -- rolls
by, tearing up the unseamed ground.  Something pours up
out of the tear -- ooze or stuffing.

Adam runs forward and stares after the wheel, which is
now out of sight.


TWO SMALLER GEARS

looking very much like components of a giant watch --
spin along behind him.  One of them veers suddenly
toward him, and though Adam jumps out of the way, the
gear snags his trouser leg and shreds it.  LOUD
TICKING.


A PERFECTLY ENORMOUS GEAR

comes barreling toward him.  Adam leaps out of its
way.  The gear turns, fish-tailing, kicking up ooze and
stuffing.

Adam flings himself suddenly to the right, but trips
into the path of the gear.  As he's about to be
crushed, he's suddenly jerked up to safety.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

It's Barbara who's grabbed him, and quite evidently
saved his life -- not life, perhaps -- but existence.
He's shaken, breathless.

Barbara stares at him, as if wondering what he's just
been through.

ADAM
(weakly)
You saved my -- uh -- life... or
whatever...

BARBARA
Two hours.

ADAM
What?

BARBARA
That's how long you were gone.

ADAM
(pondering that)
... Hmmm?


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara leads Adam into the house.

ADAM
Anything happen while I was away?

BARBARA
Yes, it did.  Yes, it did.  I made
a couple of small discoveries.


BARBARA

stands by the mirror over the hearth mantle.  On the
mantle is Barbara's prize collection of porcelain
horses.  Adam comes to stand beside her.  They look
into the mirror, and there is no reflection of them.

Barbara picks up one of the horses, and trots it through
the air.  The horse is imaged in the mirror.

BARBARA
(continuing)
There's that, and there's this.

She picks up an ancient, leather-bound book.  It's
yellow and worn, about the size of the Boy Scout
manual.

CLOSEUP:  Its title is HANDBOOK FOR THE RECENTLY
DECEASED.

ADAM
(reading)
Handbook for the recently
diseased.

BARBARA
Deceased.  I don't know where it
came from.  Look at the publisher.

ADAM
(he does and reads)
Handbook for the Recently Deceased
Press.

BARBARA
(finally admit-
ting it)
I don't think we survived the
crash.


INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam is already in bed, reading from the handbook.
Barbara is getting ready for bed -- going through a
ritual of sorts that they practiced every night of
their married lives.

BARBARA
I don't like situations like this.
I hate it when I'm not in control.
So just tell me the basics.

ADAM
This book isn't arranged that
way.  What do you want to know?

BARBARA
There are a thousand things... Why
did you disappear when you walked
off the front porch?  Is this a
punishment?  Are we halfway to
heaven or are we halfway to hell?
And how long is this going to
last?

ADAM
I don't see anything about
""Rewards and Punishments"" or
""Heaven and Hell.""
(frustrated)
This book reads like stereo
instructions!  Listen to this...
'Geographical and Temporal
Perimeters... Functional
perimeters vary from manifestation
to manifestation.""  This is going
to take some time.


BARBARA

paces, she trips on her wallpaper rolls.  Kicks them.

BARBARA
I knew I'd never finish the guest
room.  Adam, we just can't stay in
here forever!

They look at each other, the question hangs in the air.
Can't they?

Adam stands and walks to the window.

ADAM
(thoughtfully)
Maybe we should set up a normal
routine.

She looks at him like he's nuts.

ADAM
(continuing)
I mean, let's try to nail down
something in our lives.  A regular
schedule.  We can keep track of
time and go on with our projects
up here in the attic.

She shakes her head, exasperated.  Flops down on the
bed.

BARBARA
Oh, God, maybe this is all just a
bad dream.

ON ADAM - TIGHT - a somber look comes across his face.

ADAM
I'm afraid not, honey.

Barbara looks up at him, questioningly.

BARBARA
Why?  What's wrong?  Adam?

She stands and joins him at the window.


THEIR POV THROUGH THE WINDOW

In the distance we see an automobile funeral procession
threading its way toward the nearby cemetery.  Head-
lights are on.  We recognize Jane's car in the line.


REVERSE ON BARBARA AND ADAM

somber faces.


TIGHTER ON PROCESSION

It arrives at the gravesite.  We see some familiar
faces, Ernie, and Old Bill the Barber.  Jane and little
Jane watch as two identical coffins are carried to-
gether, to two open graves.


ON BARBARA AND ADAM

She drops her head sadly on his shoulder.  He leans his
face slightly into hers.

FADE OUT.


FADE IN:

INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam is setting up a small monument in the model town
cemetery.  It reads:  ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND/UNITED
IN LIFE/UNDIVIDED IN DEATH.

ADAM
I wish I had a better view of the
cemetery from up here.  I don't
know which area is the best
placement for us.

Barbara, trying to clean, lets out a frustrated YELP!
She paces.

ADAM
(continuing)
Cabin fever, han?

BARBARA
I can't clean anything.  The
vacuum is out in the garage.  I
can't leave the house.  Why don't
they tell us something?  Where are
all the other dead people in the
world?  Why is it just you and me?

ADAM
Maybe this is heaven.

BARBARA
(looking at the
dusty walls)
In heaven there wouldn't be dust
on the wallpaper.

ADAM
Hon... I didn't want to die, but
really, this is fine with me.
Look, we never have to wash dishes
again.

BARBARA
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three
weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you.  I
really need to be around people,
get out to the church and go
grocery shopping.

ADAM
But I'm not hungry, are you?

Barbara shakes her head and picks up the Handbook and
pages through it desperately.

BARBARA
I keep having this feeling that
something has got to happen.

CAR DOOR SLAMS outside.  Adam and Barbara look at one
another.  Run to window.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane Butterfield is staring up at the old house.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam, from his angle, can just barely see her.

ADAM
God, it's Jane.

BARBARA
What's she doing here?

ADAM
I don't know.
(shouting)
Jane, Jane, up here!


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Unhearing, Jane heads for car.  SOUND OF WIND UP.
Blows her dress.  Little Jane straggles along with her
like an apprentice.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara watches Adam, and shakes her head.  He stops.

BARBARA
She can't see you, right?

Adam nods.

BARBARA
(continuing)
In the book, Rule Number Two:  the
living usually won't see the dead.

ADAM
Won't?  Or can't?

BARBARA
Just says ""won't.""  Wait a minute.
Here it says ""the living are
arrogant... they think they'll
never die, so they refuse to see
the dead.""

ADAM
Arrogant.  That's Jane all right...

Barbara sighs and nods.

BARBARA
At least we won't have to worry
about her.

Adam smiles and goes to his model.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane drives away.  CAMERA HINGES to see a FOR SALE
sign.  Across it -- another smaller banner.  It reads:
SOLD!

CUT TO:


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

The Maitlands are asleep.  CAMERA EXPLORES the room a
bit.  It is getting slightly tatty.  Adam rolls over,
pulling the covers off Barbara.  We see:

ON BARBARA -- she is hovering off the side of the bed.

An OMINOUS RUMBLE -- like a 4.0 earthquake shakes
the house.  GLASS RATTLES, the ceramic horses on the
mantelpiece jump around.  Barbara falls to the floor.
They look at one another with horror.  They leap up and
run downstairs.


INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

The RUMBLE BUILDS TO A CLIMAX, there is a LOUD METALLIC
SQUEAL, and then a CRASH... just as Barbara and Adam
arrive.


THE FRONT DOOR

smashes open revealing a moving van ramp.


A TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC-BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH

slides smoothly down the ramp.  On the couch sits DELIA
DEETZ.

The couch CRASHES into the base of the staircase,
smashing the newel post and several of the balusters.
Barbara cringes.  One of the balusters falls at Delia's
side.  She grasps it like a scepter.

Two MOVING MEN rush down the ramp.

MOVING MAN #1
Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.

DELIA
Don't worry.  It was going anyway.

Delia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion-
able, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured.

She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara
and Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale
image.

Delia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks
through Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there
(which to her eyes they're not).

Still holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch
and moves into the living room, surveying it with an
odd mixture of ambition, and resolution.


BEHIND HER

the two Moving Men bring in a matching blue leather
armchair.  In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ.

Lydia, age 14, is a pretty girl, but wan, pale and
overly-dramatic, dressed as she is in her favorite
color, black.  She's a combination of a little death
rocker and an 80's version of Edward Gorey's little
girls.

She has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck
-- and is already taking photographs of the moving
men.  Lydia is cool, Lydia is sullen, Lydia is her
father's daughter by his first marriage.  Lydia is
usually about half-pissed off.  But underneath... we
like her a lot.

The Moving Men still hold up the chair, waiting for
Delia to decide where she wants it.

DELIA
(continuing)
Jesus.  Who lived here?  The
Waltons?

TIGHT ON Lydia -- calmly surveys the house.

Delia signals wearily that the Moving Men can put the
chair down anywhere.

DELIA
(continuing)
Get all this other crap out of
here.

Lydia hops down out of the chair, and comes farther
into the living room.

DELIA
(continuing)
Where is your father?... probably
in the kitchen.

That's the cue for CHARLES DEETZ, who comes in through
the swinging door, and across the dining room... a ner-
vous but basically pleasant man, CHARLES DEETZ is
intent on attacking rest and relaxation with the same
vengeance that earned him millions in real estate.

CHARLES
The noise in that kitchen.  Noisy
refrigerator, noisy faucets...
We'll have to replace it all.  I
want no humming in the house.


LYDIA

exploring on her own, gazes around the living room with
growing pleasure, she backs up for a good angle to
photograph.

CAMERA HINGES -- She is standing with her back right up
to Barbara -- who is horrified at this creature.

Charles enters.

CHARLES
(to Lydia)
What do you think, honey?

LYDIA
Delia hates it.

Lydia gazes at a dusty maze of spider webs.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I could live here.

A movement makes Lydia turn around and scream.  It is
Delia.  Not Barbara.

DELIA
Settle down, Lydia.  I wonder
where we are going to get
counseling for you out here.

A VIOLENT FALSETTO SCREAM turns the Deetz family's
attention to the front windows.

OTHO (O.S.)
Help!  Oh help!


OTHO'S MASSIVE BODY

Wedged in the window frame.  The short, stubby legs,
dressed in the world's largest pair of Georgia Armani
slacks, protrude into the living room, waving fran-
tically.  Expensive Italian loafers are kicked off the
feet, revealing a pair of expensive patterned socks.
By their feet shall ye know them.

DELIA
It's Otho!

CHARLES
Otho, why didn't you just come in
the door?

Otho's voice comes as if from a great distance.

OTHO (O.S.)
It's bad luck.  And I believe
hugely in luck.

DELIA
Hold your breath and we'll pull.

Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't
get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room
single-handedly.

All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out
the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous
new furniture.

Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and
faggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer
carries nasty emotional weight as well.


OTHO

holds onto the curtains for support as he is pulled
through the window.  And when he is at last all the way
through, and upright on his feet, he suddenly gives a
tremendous yank.  The whole drapery apparatus,
including valences, crashes to the floor.

OTHO
That was the single most
unattractive window treatment I
have ever seen in the entire of my
existence.

DELIA
(starry eyed)
I'm so glad you could leave the
city to consult me, Otho.

Otho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet
horror.

OTHO
Yes, of course you are.  Well,
Otho had an intuition.  Call it a
hunch -- that it was going to be a
fabled monstrosity of a house.
And it certainly is.  Charles,
you're lucky the yuppies are
buying condos, so you can afford
what I'm going to have to do to
this place.  We are talking from
the ground ups'ville!

CHARLES
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me
out of it.  I am here to relax and
clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I
mean to do it.

He exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house.
During this speech, Otho has been surreptitiously pos-
ing for Lydia's camera.  She clicks the shutter.

OTHO
(ignoring her)
Is the rest of the house as bad as
this?

DELIA
The rest of the house is probably
worse.  When can you and I get
started?

OTHO
No time like the present, as my
wicked stepmother used to say.

Out of the pockets of his size 56 Georgia Armani
jacket, Otho takes two cans of spray paint -- the kind
the graffiti artists use -- and shakes them as if they
were castanets.  They certainly sound like it.

OTHO
Delia, let's get this show on the
road.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

At one end, near the stairs leading up to the attic,
Barbara and Adam are slumped against opposite walls.

BARBARA
Adam, we are in hell.  I hate
these people.

ADAM
They make Jane look good.

BARBARA
Is this a punishment for something
we did in life?  What can we do?

ADAM
(determined)
We're not completely helpless.
I've been reading the book.
There's a word for people in our
predicament, honey.

Barbara looks at him.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Ghosts!

Barbara is shocked at the reality.

Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the
hallway.

OTHO
We're dealing with negative
entertainment potential here.  I
mean, there's absolutely no organic
walking flow-through.

Otho looks down the hallway.  It's empty.  Adam and
Barbara are no longer there.

DELIA
What's wrong?

OTHO
I thought I saw something.

DeLia turns and spray-paints on the wall -- in luminous
orange -- the word MAUVE.

DELIA
Okay?

OTHO
(screaming with delight)
You read my mind!  I love clients
who can read my mind.  I don't
think people realize how strong a
connection there is between
interior design and the
supernatural.

DELIA
(fawning)
I know... I read your book, The
Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf.

OTHO
Gooood!

Delia opens the door and they step inside another room.

DELIA
This will be Lydia's room.


INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - DAY

It's not Lydia's room yet, of course, because it still
has the Maitlands' furniture in it.  Barbara had partly
wallpapered it before the accident.  Her tools are still
there.

DELIA
What do you think?

OTHO
Viridian?

DELIA
Viridian?  What is...?

Otho spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- plus
the word BLUE GREEN -- and Cr2 03, right over a picture
of Adam and Barbara as kids.

OTHO
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic
oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in
chemistry.  I was a hair analyst!
Briefly.  Interior design is a
science, Delia!  Think of me as
Doctor Otho.
(looking at wall)
And this patient is truly sick!

DELIA
Of course, her favorite color!
How beautiful!

Delia smiles.  Behind Delia and Otho, the room's closet
door swings slowly open with and ominous CREAK.


DELIA AND OTHO

turn that way, with a suggestion of dread.  Inside the
closet, Barbara's corpse is suspended from the ceiling
by a belt.  The corpse twists with a CREAK, and Barbara
grins ghostly -- and slowly tears off her face, leaving
nothing but muscle and bone beneath.  Her eyeballs
dangle on her cheeks.

Delia and Otho stare aghast.

DELIA
Oh my God!

OTHO
We just have to pray that the
other closets are bigger than this
one.

He walks over.  Looks inside.

OTHO
(continuing)
Were these people dwarfes? (sic)
(spies something)
Oooooo!...  Look!

He finds, neatly hung in plastic, the Maitlands'
wedding outfits.  Totally captivated by this powerful
image, he peers through the plastic at them.  Holding
each up to Delia.  Barbara watches wide-eyed at them.

OTHO
(continuing)
Ozzie...
(holding up
her dress)
... and... Harriet!  What happened
to these people?

Delia slams the door in Barbara's contorted face.

DELIA
They died.


INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

Delia and Otho come out of Lydia's bedroom and go
through the bathroom.  Disgusted, they continue on to
the study.


OTHO

reaches out and turns the knob.  The door swings omi-
nously open on Charles' study.  This had been Adam's
reading and birdwatching study.  Bird posters on the
wall, books everywhere.  Straight out of Better Homes
and Gardens 1963.

OTHO
Ooo.  Deliver me from L.L. Bean!


ANGLE

There is one slight difference, however, because on the
rag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adam's headless
corpse.  Standing over him, holding in one hand a long
knife and in the other Adam's blood-and-gore dripping
head is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face.
Behind them, Charles is thumbing through Adam's Audubon
collection.  He sits up like a cornered animal protect-
ing his territory.

CHARLES
(to Otho and Delia)
This room is off limits.  I don't
want either of you to touch one
piece of furniture in here.  This
is my room.


INSIDE THE ROOM

The eyes of Adam's severed head open and look up at
Barbara -- she stops screaming.

ADAM'S HEAD
They don't see us.  They can't
hear us.

Outside, Delia is shaking her head.

DELIA
The woman who lived here had the
aesthetic instincts of Betty
Crocker.

BARBARA
I'm going to get her.

DELIA
I cannot convey to you the extent
to which this house bores me.

OTHO
(looking around
scientifically)
Once you cover up the wallpaper,
knock down a few walls, alter the
traffic patterns, and -- perhaps
-- think about an inground pool --
the place might just be livable.
What's on the third floor?

DELIA
Attic space.

OTHO
Let's see.  We could turn that
into a media room.

They head up the stars to the attic.


INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Adam's head has a look of terror on it.

ADAM'S HEAD
Oh, God.  I forgot to lock the
attic door!

Adam's headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes
out of the room.


INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - SAME TIME

Otho and Delia climbing.  The headless corpse careens
past them, around the bend in the stairs and out of
sight.

OTHO
Did you feel something?

Delia shakes her head.

OTHO
(continuing)
I felt a cool wind.

The expression on Otho's face suggests he knows more
than he's telling.


INT. LANDING OUTSIDE ATTIC DOOR - SAME TIME

The headless corpse rushes through the open door into
the attic.


INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME

The headless corpse slams the door shut, turns the key
in the lock.  Then he slumps against the locked door in
an exaggerated stance of relief.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - SAME TIME

Delia tries the knob.  The door is locked.

OTHO
You don't have a key?

DELIA
Maybe Charles does.

OTHO
I have a feeling there's some very
interesting space behind this
door.

DELIA
(sarcastic)
Probably the world's largest
Reader's Digest collection!
C'mon, let's have some chablis,
Otho, I'm laid bare by this
experience.  Entirely bare.


INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Barbara still holding Adam's head.

Charles still calmly leafing through the Audubons.

ADAM'S HEAD
Whew!  That was close.

BARBARA
I cannot witness this.

Barbara distractedly puts Adam's head on a bookshelf.
His headless body fumbles with the books and finally
reattaches the head.


INT. STUDY - DAY

Adam turns away from the window.

Barbara, fuming, moves around Charles making wild
gestures.

BARBARA
What's the good of being a ghost
if you can't frighten people to
death?

ADAM
Oh, honey...

BARBARA
No, I'm not putting up with this.

She storms out of the room.


INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Barbara storms in, as if straight from the room up-
stairs.  She heads straight for the back door.  Just as
she opens the door, Adam rushes up.

ADAM
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out
there.  You don't know --

BARBARA
Nothing can be worse than this...

She flings open the door and steps outside.  She
promptly disappears.

ADAM
Barbara!


EXT. SURFACE OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN - DAY

Barbara plunges into the dusty surface of Titan with an
enormous Saturn looming in the sky.  She looks around
with wonder and some fear.


A SULFUR VOLCANO

erupts in the distance.  A meteor CRASHES with a lurid
EXPLOSION.  As from a great distance she hears Adam's
VOICE.  Like THUNDER.

ADAM
Barbara!

She turns slowly in the yellow dense sand that covers
the surface of this distant moon.


BARBARA'S POV

Adam is trudging towards her.  Behind him, hovering
isolated in the air, is the kitchen door.


BACK TO SCENE

Adam at last catches up with her.  Surveys around them.

BARBARA
Oh Adam.  Find somebody.  I'm
getting all yellow.  Do something!


BEHIND THEM

Something is burrowing rapidly toward them through the
sand.  The Something could be right out of ""Dune"".


BARBARA AND ADAM

stare for a moment, then Adam grabs her and pulls her
toward the kitchen door.  But the kitchen door has
moved, so they veer in the new direction.

The Something follows them and rises out of the sand.


ON SOMETHING

It is a very big, very nasty, and very hungry SNAPPING
SANDWORM.  It ROARS and lunges at them.


BARBARA

slightly angered at it, instinctively bats at it.


THE SANDWORM

is momentarily stunned at Barbara's audacity.  It
freezes and shakes its loathesome head.


BARBARA

bats at it again.  Adam is wide-eyed, tries to pull her
away.  The Sandworm recovers and ROARS after them.


ADAM

grabs Barbara and tries to escape, but they slip and
sink in the sand.

They make it to the door just in time, swing it open
and hurl themselves through.  The door shuts with a
BANG just in front of the ROARING SANDWORM.

THE SANDWORM

rears and ROARS in frustration, HOWLING to the ringed
planet.


INT. KITCHEN

Barbara, weeping, throws herself in Adam's arms.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me
alone.

ADAM
You left me.

BARBARA
I know.  I'm sorry.

She hugs him tight.

BARBARA
(continuing)
I just realized that I could have
been killed alone.  Don't ever
leave me, honey.

Both contemplate that horror.

BARBARA
(continuing)
We're trapped in this house
forever... with those... people.

ADAM
You can't say that for sure.  It
could be a transitional thing.
Like a post-life crisis.  We just
have to be tougher with them.
Come on.  Have some brandy.
Spirits?

BARBARA
(a tentative smile)
Death didn't improve your sense of
humor.

They head for the dining room.


INT. DINING ROOM

Adam has his arms around Barbara's shoulder.  They walk
in the door and stumble upon the Deetzes at their
dinner.  Lydia's back is to them.  Barbara and Adam
back out of the room but stop to listen.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

The Deetz's around the dining room table.  There are
candles and good china laid out-- but they're eating
out of Chinese take-out boxes.

DELIA
I can't believe that we're eating
Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan
up here?  Hunan?

CHARLES
There's only one Chinese
restaurant out here, darling, the
owners are Irish and Irish people
happen to cook Cantonese.  They
don't know better.

LYDIA
I plan to have a stroke from the
amount of MSG that's in this food.

DELIA
This is our first meal in this
house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do
our little private parts to make
it a pleasant one?

CHARLES
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a
darkroom in the basement.

LYDIA
(dramatically)
My whole life is a darkroom!
One... big... dark... room.

Delia rolls her eyes and nods.  She's been through this
before.

DELIA
Nonsense... you'll go to school,
maybe meet a farm boy.

Delia laughs.  Charles smiles.

LYDIA
(doleful)
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll
let me hang myself from a rope in
his barn.

CHARLES
Lydia, in a couple of years this
whole town will be filled with
people like us.

DELIA
We'll be the art center of summer
New York.  I'll start sculpting
again... I'll teach those gallery
bastards to refuse my sculpture.
And when Otho and I get through
with this house, you people are
not going to recognize it.

LYDIA
(dramatically)
I say let's keep it the way it is.

Delia stares at Lydia.

CHARLES
(smiles)
Good idea!

Delia shifts her glare to Charles.

LYDIA
I do.  I really like it.  I
mean, it's already sort of like
somebody's home, isn't it?  Their
couch is comfortable and doesn't
stick to your legs.  It smells
like a real home, not a French
whorehouse.

DELIA
Lydia, at your age, you are so
young.
(back to business)
Charles, we need to call that
awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow
and get the key to the attic door.
Can't you find a way to hold back
some of her commission?

CHARLES
We're going to have a lot to do
tomorrow...
The Goodwill truck is coming.

DELIA
... and whatever is up there in
that attic goes away with it.

CHARLES
Should have it fumigated, too.  I
saw a fly today.

Lydia looks at them with a mixture of sadness and
anger.


OUTSIDE THE DOOR - ON THE STAIRS

-- listening, sit Barbara and Adam.  A tear rolls down
her face.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam and Barbara are lying down on the floor, peering
out of one of the small windows overlooking the front
yard of the house.  The handbook open in front of them.


EXT. FRONT YARD - ADAM AND BARBARA'S POV - DAY

The entire front yard is alive with workmen and their
vehicles.  Plumbers, electricians, cable TV men, etc.
In the road on front of the house are several cars of
rubbernecking locals, astonished by all the activity.
The City has come to Town.  Moving men continue to move
in the Deetz' modern, expensive and ugly furniture.
They collide with Goodwill men coming out with the
Maitlands' lovely antiques and personal possessions.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam and Barbara just look at one another as if to say
""We're next!""  Adam leafs through the handbook furi-
ously.

BARBARA
Look in the index...

ADAM
Not really...  what's this?

Adam pulls from the book an ancient, yellowed,
crumbling handbill.  He carefully opens it.

ON handbill -- very primitive, crude, red printing.

ADAM (V.O.)
(reading)
Having difficulty adjusting?
Is death a problem and not a
solution?  Unhappy with eternity?
Troubled by the living?  Call
Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.
That's Betelgeuse,  Betel...

The remainder of the sheet is torn off.

ON Barbara -- fingering the torn edge.  Looking in the
book for the remainder.  No luck.

BARBARA
That's it?  No number, or
instructions?

ADAM
Nothing.  The bio-exorcist?  I
don't get it...


INT. KITCHEN

Charles, away from the chaos outside is calmly steeping
a mug of herb tea.  His solitude is interrupted by a
2500 lb. Vulcan range breaking through a too-small
kitchen window.

CHARLES
(shouting through
the window)
What the hell are you trying to do
out there?


DELIA - OUTSIDE

is berating the inept crane operator and shrieks
periodically at some fine art movers who are struggling
under her horrid modern welded steel sculptures.


LYDIA

snaps photos of the mayhem.  She stops to scan the whole
house.


LYDIA'S POV

When her gaze reaches to top of the house, she suddenly
glimpses Barbara and Adam's faces in the window.


BACK TO SCENE

Lydia blinks hard.  Her mouth drops open.  She looks
all around -- as if she'd just seen a ghost or two.


JANE BUTTERFIELD'S CAR

pulls up.  Little Jane sits in the front seat, burdened
with an enormous stack of collated and stapled copies.

Lydia catches sight of Jane and runs over.

Little Jane locks her door, in fear of Lydia-the
strange.  Lydia stares at her.

LITTLE JANE
Are you a boy or a girl?

LYDIA
I only speak to vertebrates.

LYDIA
What happened to the people who
used to live here?

LITTLE JANE
(ratty little voice)
They drowned!

JANE
Yes, they were family.  I was
devastated.
(beat)
Here, darling.

Jane hands a key to Lydia.

LYDIA
(impressed)
Is this the key to the attic?

JANE
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open
any door in that house.  Will you
give it to your father?
(handing her a
business card)
And you might mention that I
single-handedly decorated the
house.  In case he needs advice in
that area.  Come see me.

Jane goes away.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Lydia's face sobers as she looks up at the now empty
attic window.

DELIA (O.S.)
Help!  Get off me!

Lydia drops the skeleton key into her pocket surrepti-
tiously.  She follows Delia's SHRIEKING.


EXT. HOUSE - DAY

Lydia rounds the corner to see Delia, pinned flat
against the house by one of her horrid steel sculp-
tures.  Two movers are struggling to free her.  Lydia
snaps a quick photograph.

They finally free Delia.  She clutches at her head,
just short of tearing her hair out.

DELIA
You jerks!  That is my art, and it
is dangerous!  You think I want to
want to die like that?
(seeing Lydia)
Lydia.  Moving is a family affair.
So buckle down now and go get
Mommy some drugs.

LYDIA
Any particular kind?

DELIA
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!

Lydia walks off toward the house.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara is half-hiding on the edge of the window.

BARBARA
That little girl saw us.

ADAM
She couldn't have.  We can't make
them see us.

BARBARA
But she saw us.  I could feel it.

ADAM
(pause, thinking
that over)
That's all we need.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia looks up the stairs at the attic landing.  She's
a little scared.  She decides to go up the dark stairs.

IN THE HALL

At the end of the hall stands Charles, directing men
who are carrying books into the room that will be his
study.

He continues on.


A BLAST of STEAM

fills the hallway, because workmen are already going at
the wallpaper.  Lydia emerges from it.  Looking up at
stairway to attic, mounting courage.


INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - DAY

Lydia creeps upward, taking the skeleton key from her
pocket.  FLOORBOARDS SQUEAK.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam works on his model.  He hears the SQUEAK, looks up
confidently.

ADAM
(whispering)
Don't worry.  I've locked it.

Barbara smiles and knits while rocking in her chair.


INT. ATTIC LANDING

Lydia quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic
door.  She turns it.  The key is stiff.  She turns
harder.  It's stuck.  Lydia tries the door -- it's no
go.  She turns the key again.  This time it goes all
the way around.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara and Adam, surprised by the key, look at each
other, carefully, very quietly, stand up and tiptoe
toward door.


ON THE SCREEN OF AN OLD TV SET

in the corner of the attic -- Suddenly -- a ghostly
image POPS ON.


ON TV - A BIZARRE, SMALLISH FELLOW

outfitted in a too-big cowboy hat, bad wig, and over-
sized sunglasses appears on screen singing very
quickly.  (It's a heavily disguised BETELGEUSE.)


BEHIND HIM

the CAMERA QUICKLY PANS an assortment of tombstones a
la Cal Worthington.

BETELGEUSE
(singing)
Have the living got you down?
Betelgeuse!
Are they jacking you around?
Betelgeuse!
Have you broken out in hives
'Cause you're tired of their jive?
I will drive them from your
hive... Betelgeuse!


ANOTHER ANGLE

CAMERA TILTS DOWN a flashing tombstone with
""BETELGEUSE"" written on it.  Adam rushes over to shut
it off.  He can't find a plug.  He looks around behind
set... no workings inside at all.  He peers around to
the screen.  It is blank.  Suddenly -- Betelgeuse POPS
ON AGAIN.

BETELGEUSE
Say it once... Betelgeuse
Say it twice... Betelgeuse.
The third time's a charm...
Betelgeuse!
Come on down!

He POPS OFF.  Adam and Barbara stare at each other.


INT. LANDING - DAY

Lydia listens.  Did she hear something?  She puts her
hand on the knob and tries to turn it.  It's stuck.

Then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on
the floor.

Charles' head suddenly appears behind her.  Scares her.

CHARLES
What are you doing?


INT. ATTIC

Adam is holding on tight to the knob of the door.  With
her knitting needle, Barbara has poked the key out.

The two stand absolutely still, listening, terrified of
the living intruders.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - LYDIA AND CHARLES

LYDIA
I was just trying to open the
door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought
over a skeleton key.

CHARLES
Let me have it.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara and Adam tighten.


ON THE LANDING

LYDIA
But it doesn't work.

She hands her father the key.  He looks at it and
throws it in the corner.

CHARLES
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway,
this can wait.  We'll get a
crowbar later.  Where's your
mother?

LYDIA
(very quick de-
cisive delivery)
Stepmother.

CHARLES
I'm going down to relax.  I want a
noise-free zone.  Do you
understand?  Noise-free.

He goes down the stairs.

LYDIA
Dad?

He continues.

CHARLES
(irritated, over
his shoulder)
What?

LYDIA
I'm lonely.

A BLAST OF STEAM from below drowns out her words.
Charles stops and turns around.  The BLAST STOPS.

CHARLES
What?


TIGHT ON LYDIA

She is resolved.

LYDIA
Nothing.

Charles continues.  She begins to follow slowly.


ON KEY

behind Lydia.  WIDEN as Adam rushes out the door, grabs
the key and rushes back in again.  Lydia hears some-
thing but doesn't see.


INT. ATTIC

Barbara and Adam have moved away from the door.

ADAM
(looking through
the handbook)
We need some help.  I found
something this morning.  Here.
Emergencies.
(reads)
""In case of emergency, draw door.""

BARBARA
Draw door?  I don't know why we
keep looking in that stupid book.

Adam takes a piece of chalk and draws a little door on
the exposed brick of the chimney.

BARBARA
(continuing)
You don't actually think this
is going to work?

Adam draws a doorknob.  Then he tries to turn it.  The
door, perhaps to his surprise, fails to open.

BARBARA
Yet another triumph for Adam and
Barbara in the afterlife.  Why
don't we try this Beetle guy??...

ADAM
Wait.

He looks at book, then writes on the door:  KNOCK AND
ENTER.  He exchanges a glance with Barbara.  She's even
more skeptical than before.  Turns away in disgust.

Adam knocks on the door, and turns the knob.  Nothing.
She is more disgusted.  Adam goes back to the book.

ADAM
(continuing)
Aha!  Knock three times.


ANOTHER ANGLE

He knocks three times.  Turns knob.  The chalked door
swings magnificently open.

Behind is an eerie light source, SOARING MUSIC, maybe
even a heavenly choir singing pear-shaped syllables.

Barbara and Adam look at one another again.  They hold
hands and step tentatively through.

Their figures are lost in the blinding light.

They start to shut door after them.


ON THE ATTIC LANDING

Lydia is staring at the light pouring from under the
attic door.  It suddenly goes out.

ON LYDIA

She is dumbfounded.  She listens.


ON THE LANDING

Lydia speeds down the steps.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - DAY

Charles, fiercely intent on relaxing, paces like a
catfish out of water.  Ralph Lauren in K-mart.  He
stretches.  He sits uneasily in an easy chair, tries
like hell to get comfortable.  Finally, he puts a book
under his bottom to get sitting straight.  Looks around
tapping his fingers.  What to do?  Looks at watch.

He takes down a book from Adam's library, it is an
Audubon book of birds.  He whips through it like it's
the comics and then looks around for more.

He finds the ""Illustrated Walden"" by Thoreau.  He
speed reads it.

He is now really bored.  Goes to the fireplace, tries
to light it.  Cannot do it.  Goes to desk and writes:

OTHO-INSTALL GAS FIRE LOGS IN
STUDY.

He studies bird posters.  Finds beautiful cardinal
picture.

Takes field glasses and looks out window.


HIS POV

Spies big ugly-looking ratty bird devouring something.


ON CHARLES

horrified.  Wrinkles his nose.

Lydia enters.  He jumps.

CHARLES
Jesus Christ!

Lydia is shocked.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Darling, can't you see I'm
relaxing in here!

LYDIA
Well I just wanted to tell you
what I saw.

CHARLES
Lydia.  What the hell is the point
of my moving up here if you people
won't let me relax?  Go help your
mother.

Charles returns to field glasses, spies something.  She
looks at him in frustration.

LYDIA
(on her way out)
Fine.  Maybe you can relax in a
haunted house.  But I can't.

She exits.  Charles peers after her, brow furrowed.
Looks out again at the village.  Uses his field glasses
to get a better look.


HIS POV

It is the Bozman Building.  Ernie is out front pol-
ishing the brass lion.


ON CHARLES

He thinks.  Moves the field glasses to punctuate his
discovery of the building.  (His eyes never leave field
glasses throughout the following.)

CHARLES
Nice building... Bad paint.  Good
lines... bad roof.  Good
parking... hmmm???

That really registers with him.  Without looking, he
dials a familiar number on the phone with one hand,
lifts the receiver.  He clacks his teeth together pur-
posefully.

SECRETARY'S VOICE
Botco International.

CHARLES
Yes, I'd like to speak with Maxie
Dean.

SECRETARY'S VOICE
He's not in right now.

CHARLES
Well tell him that Charles Deetz
called.

He hangs up and continues to spy on Bozman Building.
Clacks his teeth.

CHARLES
(continuing)
My God what I could do with that
parking.

DISSOLVE TO:


TIGHT SHOT - BARBARA AND ADAM

Very still, they look cautiously to the right and left
-- just with their eyes.  They're astounded by what
they see, though we don't yet see it.

ADAM
... Not what I expected when we
walked through that door.

BARBARA
No. But it's somewhere without big
worms.

CAMERA DRAWS BACK and we find that Adam and Barbara are
in:


INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

The most unpleasant waiting room that you ever remember
waiting in.  Fifties furniture with broken legs,
couches propped up on telephone books.

Standing ashtrays with dirty stand.  Linoleum floors
patched a hundred times.  National Geographics with the
covers torn off.  The ""Take a number"" registers in the
millions.


AS THE CAMERA COMPLETES A CIRCLE OF THE ROOM

We see a RECEPTIONIST.  She's the quintessential 50's
receptionist -- tight sweater, bullet-breasted bra,
bleached hair, red lipstick.  She's wearing a ribbon
across her breast reading ""MISS ARGENTINA"" and there
are knife slashes across both wrists.

RECEPTIONIST
You don't have an appointment, do
you?

ADAM
W... We didn't know how to make one.

BARBARA
An appointment for what?

RECEPTIONIST
What do you want?

BARBARA
We need some help.

RECEPTIONIST
Already?  You just bit the big one
nine months ago and you want help?

ADAM
Nine months?  What difference does
that make?

RECEPTIONIST
(shrugging)
Good luck.  You're going to use up
all your help vouchers.

ADAM
Help vouchers?

RECEPTIONIST
D-90's.  You spend a hundred
and twenty-five years on earth,
actually, in that house, during
which you get only three class-one
D-90 intercessions with Juno.  You
probably haven't even read through
the manual completely yet.

BARBARA
Why three?


TYPIST

Behind the Receptionist holds up both hands each of
which have only three fingers on them.

TYPIST
Rule Number Three.  Everything
comes in threes...

RECEPTIONIST
You'll have to wait if you don't
have an appointment.

BARBARA
How long do we have to wait?

ADAM
Wait for who?

RECEPTIONIST
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not
that it matters to your type.  But
there are all these other people
here ahead of you.  I'd say 3
hours.

The waiting room is now filled with people.  Dead
people, some in fairly awful states.  A cornucopia of
carnal shreddage.

Adam and Barbara look around for a moment, then very
quietly, they reach out to grasp hands.

RECEPTIONIST
(continuing)
Number 54 million, six hundred
one.  Ferndock.

CAMERA PUSHES IN CLOSE.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. ATTIC LANDING - DAY

Lydia kneels down with a screwdriver, a nail file, an
ice pick, and a credit card.  She inserts nail file
into the door.  She struggles, and after several
attempts -- finally uses the ice pick and POP!  The
door swings open ominously.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia enters.  The room is dim, and filled with dust
motes.  There are shadows in all the corners.

She bumps into a switch which engages the model sun and
moon and that eerily illuminates the model town.  She's
frightened, then entranced.

She peers at it from different angles, her fear for-
gotten.  She notes small tools scattered around an
unfinished area.  She continues around the model,
oblivious to everything else.  Then...

She kicks something.  Ducks under the table and comes
up with something, holds it up to the light.  It's the
handbook.  She looks through it.  Finds the marked
page... looks at the chalk door.


INT. OFFICE - DAY

Barbara and Adam are still holding hands, as if they
hadn't moved.  Like waiting for an IRS audit.

BARBARA
(to Adam)
Is this what happens when you die?

The Receptionist overhears.  She points at Barbara.

RECEPTIONIST
This is what happens when YOU die.
(points to another
corpse)
That is what happens when HE dies.
That is what happens when THEY
die.  It's highly personal.  And
I'll tell you something... if I
knew then what I know now... I
wouldn't have had my little
""accident!""

She holds up her wrists and smiling at her little joke,
wriggles them indicating her slashes.

OTHER CORPSES
(all together)
Amen!

Barbara and Adam look at them.  Corpses resume doing
what they were doing.  A GRINDING NOISE O.S. -- The
Receptionist looks up.

Barbara and Adam also look O.S.


THEIR POV

A Message delivery wire GRINDS along loudly on a
pulley.  The actual message is held in the hand of the
MESSENGER, a flattened corpse, suspended as if on a
shirt clothesline, tire marks on his face and clothing.
A major roadkill.  Dust and gravel ground into him.  He
smiles wanly at Barbara and Adam as the Receptionist
takes a message on a piece of paper and reads it.

RECEPTIONIST
Maitland, party of two!  Take your
handbook and go to the sixth door.

Barbara and Adam upset at the loss of their handbook...

BARBARA
We forgot our handbook.

CUT TO:


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is studying the handbook with intense interest.

CHARLES (O.S.)
(from distant
downstairs)
Lydia, Delia needs your help!

Lydia gives one more look at the book, and then goes to
the door quickly and silently.

CHARLES (O.S.)
Right now, Delia says!


INT. OFFICE - DAY

RECEPTIONIST
(shaking her head
in disgust)
Out that way, through the typing
pool, down the corridor, sixth
door on your left.  Sixth door.
Two threes.
(shaking her head)
Airhead.

Adam and Barbara walk through a door.


INT. TYPING POOL - DAY

A vast room of desks arranged in a grid, straight
out of ""How To Succeed In Business""... Each desk is
occupied, too, but most of the secretaries are merely
skeletons, or mouldering corpses slumped over their
typewriters.

Only one secretary, somewhere in the vast grid, is
typing slowly, with long pauses between words.

The Messenger on his return trip, parallels Barbara and
Adam as they walk along.  Barbara can't look at him.

MESSENGER
How do I look?  There're no
mirrors on this side.

ADAM
(trying to be
pleasant)
Fine, you look fine.

MESSENGER
Thanks.  I've been feeling a
little flat.


ANOTHER ANGLE

He laughs at his own joke as he goes back through the
very, very narrow slot in the wall where the line
runs.  Adam and Barbara look to the right and left.
A vast stack of files slips off a desk and spills out
onto the floor.


INT. CORRIDOR - DAY

Barbara and Adam enter corridor.

Empty, like a hotel corridor, but all the doors are of
different types -- a revolving door, a dutch door,
church doors.  They walk past a waist-high window,
covered by a roll-up shade.

BARBARA
A hundred twenty-five years!
I can't believe it.  I can't
believe they didn't tell us.

She bumps into the shade and it rolls up FLAPPING.  She
stares in through the window.  Adam peers in it too.


THEIR POV

A smouldering, mist-filled room.  From the smoky plasma
floats an occasional tortured soul.  Unspeakably SAD
MUSIC wafts from within.  They get only a glimpse of
the bodies in this horrible human soup.

BARBARA
Adam, look at this.

Suddenly, floating up from below, immediately on the
other side of the window, a white-crepe face emerges.
It seems to be that of a woman, her eyes are red and
blue tears rim them.  Her pale skin is covered with a
flaking crust of salt.  She wears the saddest look
ever.  Her mouth opens plaintively but no sound comes.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Oh, Adam... what is this?

A reflection joins them on their side of the window.


A SINISTER LITTLE JANITOR

wizened and efficient, pulls the shade down firmly.

SINISTER MAN
That's the lost souls room.
A room for ghosts who have been
exorcised.  Poor devils.  That's
death for the dead.  It's all in
the handbook.  Keep moving.

The man scuttles off.  Adam and Barbara walk on sadly,
until they come to a door that looks exactly like the
swinging door between the kitchen and dining room of
their house.

ADAM
This is it... the sixth door.

Puzzled -- Barbara pushes it.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Everything is dark, quiet -- but the furniture is
obviously not theirs, and neither is the decoration.
Adam and Barbara exchange glances, and push on through
into the living room.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Quiet, dark.  Everyone's asleep.

ADAM
My God, we're back home.

BARBARA
Look at this, everything is
different down here.  All our
furniture is gone.

ADAM
How long do you suppose we were
waiting?

JUNO
Three months.


ANOTHER ANGLE

A spot comes on, revealing JUNO -- their caseworker.
She's an older woman, no nonsense about her.  Over-
dressed in an outfit that includes a blouse with
ruffled cuffs.  We will at some point catch a glimpse
of her slashed throat -- she smokes heavily.  Occa-
sionaly smoke puffs from her cut throat.

JUNO
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was
about to leave.  I do have other
clients.

BARBARA
Are you Juno, our caseworker?

JUNO
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases
and determine if help is needed,
deserved, and available.

BARBARA
We need help.  We deserve help.

ADAM
Are you available?

JUNO
No.
(beat)
What's wrong?

BARBARA
We're very unhappy.

JUNO
What do you expect?  You're dead.

ADAM
We'd like some help in getting rid
of the people who moved in here.
Barbara and I worked very hard on
this house.

BARBARA
We probably wouldn't mind sharing
the house with people who were --

JUNO
-- like you used to be?

BARBARA
Yes.

ADAM
But these people --

He indicates a particularly bad piece of Delia's sculp-
ture.  Juno walks around it shaking her head.


INT. HOUSE

The following conversation takes place as Barbara and
Adam follow Juno as she looks around the house and ends
up in their attic space.

JUNO
Things seem pretty quiet here.
You should thank God you didn't
die in Italy.
(checking the file)
The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been
studying the manual?

ADAM
We tried.

JUNO
The Intermediate Interface chapter
on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em
out yourself.  It's your house.
Haunted houses don't come easy.

BARBARA
We don't quite get it.

Juno's watch BUZZES, she stops it.

JUNO
I heard.
(refers to her file)
Tore your face right off!  Bad
news.  It obviously doesn't do
any good to pull your heads off in
front of people if they can't see
you.

ADAM
We have to start simpler, is that
it?

JUNO
Start simply.  Do what you know.
Use your talents.  Practice.  We
only help those who help
themselves.  Just do a little at a
time.  And of course, practice,
practice, practice.  It's tricky
but -- you weren't murderers by
any chance, were you?

BARBARA
No.

JUNO
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an
easy time of it.  Just look at
Amityville.
(reminiscing)
He was one of my boys.  Didn't
have to give that one any lessons.
From day one... But I must be
off... I've got a plane load of
football players crashed in the
midwest... they need a lot of
help, just with the basics.

Points at her head indicating dumbness.

BARBARA
If... we have trouble.  What about
the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...

JUNO
(quickly interrupt-
ing her)
Don't say his name, you don't want
his help.

Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Puzzled.

ADAM & BARBARA
Well... We might...


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Juno peers into the model cemetery with interest.  A
FLY BUZZES around her.  Juno blows it away.  Fly flees.

JUNO
No you don't!  He does not work
well with others.

BARBARA
What do you mean?  What's he do?

A grave look comes over Juno's face as the light
changes to suggest someone telling a ghost story around
a campfire.

JUNO
I wasn't going to bring it up --
but rather than have you stumble
into it and make another mistake,
I'll tell you --
(she nervously puffs
her cigarette)
He was my assistant, but he was a
troublemaker...
He went out on his own as a free-
lance bio-exorcist -- claims to
get rid of the living... got into
more trouble -- you remember the
Chicago Fire...

Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Juno continues.

JUNO
(continuing)
He was demoted to a Grade-6
malevolent spirit.  He's been
imprisoned on that plane ever
since... in fact, I believe he's
been sleezing around your cemetery
lately.  He can only be brought
back by saying his name three
times.

Adam and Barbara attempt to interrupt --

JUNO
(continuing)
But I strongly suggest that you
remove the Deetz's yourself.

She takes a final drag on the cigarette and smoke
billows out the hole in her throat.  Juno starts to
FADE.

ADAM
And if we need you again, how do
we...?

Juno fades.  Gone.  Barbara goes to the model, looks
at the cemetery.

BARBARA
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh,
Adam.

ADAM
(holds her shoul-
ders, calms her)
Look, she's right.  We'll just
start simple, honey, be tougher.
I feel... confident.  C'mon.

They exit.


CAMERA FOLLOWS ACTION - OVER THE MODEL

The FLY BUZZES.  It lands and crawls along into the model of
the cemetery.


THE FLY

resplendently green and iridescent, pauses and fiddles
with its hairy parts.  Starts to walk by.

VOICE
Pssstt!  Over here!

Fly stops.  Tilts its multi-eyed head.


ANOTHER ANGLE

Two hands come up from the earth of that grave holding
a candy bar.

VOICE
I can't use this.  You should have
it.  Flies get so little respect
anymore.


THE FLATTERED FLY

walks over to the grave.  In a flash, the hands grab
the struggling fly and dance it like a doll over the
grave and then pull it into the earth.

FLY
Buzzz!
(turns into)
Help me!  Help me!

A MANIACAL LAUGH grows from the grave.  WIND BLOWS as
the Fly disappears.  Ivy whips away from the grave-
stone.  We see, for the first time, the chiseled name:

BETELGEUSE

CLAP OF THUNDER.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT

Charles is on the phone.  He has drawings laid out in
front of him.  He is at his most urban persuasive, and
oddly relaxed -- he is finally in his own element.

CHARLES
Maxie, have I not always made you
money?  I think that is the only
real question here.


INT. MAXIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

New York office, cool design, black couch, and MAXIE
DEAN, a 55-year-old, super tan, white-haired wheeler
dealer.  Sign says:  CHAIRMAN of BOTCO INDUSTRIES.
Maxie looks rich and he looks cool as he talks to
Charles.  Behind him, Sarah, his rich-looking blonde
wife, is looking at herself in a mirror.

MAXIE
Well, Charles -- no one has made me
money like you.  Until your nerves
went, you were a demon.  It is
just that... Winter River,
Connecticut is, you'll forgive me,
no fucking where.  Why would I
invest that kind of money to buy
an old building way the hell up
there?


INTERCUT CONVERSATION

CHARLES
Not a building!  That's the beauty
of it.  I think I can buy the
whole town.  These people don't
know the value of their property!

MAXIE
Then we own a whole town full of
nowhere.

CHARLES
No, No -- C'mon, Max, you know
me.  I've got plans.  You gotta
come up here and see, then I'll
tell you about it.

Maxie isn't much interested.

MAXIE
Well, sure, Charles, but I am busy
here... you know how it was when
you were active.

This burns Charles.  But he swallows it.  He hears
something in the corridor outside -- a kind of LOW
MOANING.

CHARLES
(into telephone)
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody.

MAXIE
No listen... we'll talk about
this visiting later, I gotta go,
I gotta meeting on the Japanese
joint venture.

CHARLES
(torn between the
MOANING and Maxie)
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese
could run it for us.  Listen,
think right about it, will you?
We've almost got the house ready,
you bring Sarah with you and I'll
show you.

MAXIE
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it.
Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up
there, ya hear?

Maxie hangs up.  Shakes his head.

MAXIE
(continuing)
Putz!  Inter River?  My ass.


INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT

Charles hangs up frustrated.  MOANING INCREASES.  He
goes to the door and flings it open.

A figure is right there in the doorway -- A ghost under
a sheet.  But a ""designer"" sheet.  He wails away like a
banshee.  Eyeholes cut in sheets, Charles jumps, re-
covers.

CHARLES
Oh, Jesus, Lydia!  Is Connecticut
so boring that you have to think
up shit like this?

ON Barbara, she stands back away from the door observ-
ing skeptically.

CHARLES
(continuing)
I had Maxie Dean on the phone!
Darling, Dad's found a way to make
some money here while I relax, so
scram!

He slams the door, turns around.  Then turns around
again, and jerks the door open.  The ghost is retreat-
ing, beaten.

CHARLES
(continuing)
And your mother is going to kill
you when she sees that you cut
holes in her $300 sheets.  You
provoke her you know.  I mean she
can be an unreasonable bitch.  But
you do provoke her.

He SLAMS the door again.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

Adam helps Barbara on with her sheet.

BARBARA
God, this is so corny.  Have we
been reduced to this?  Sheets?

ADAM
Think of them as death shrouds.
And the moaning is important.
Really moan!
(imitating Juno)
Practice, practice, practice.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Television still going, Delia asleep with curlers.
Adam and Barbara glide inside, go over and stand beside
the bed.

ADAM
Deep breath... and...


INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - NIGHT

She has her ever-present camera around her neck.  Sud-
denly hears MOANS from her parents' room.  Thinking it
is sexual, she cringes.  Covers her ears.

LYDIA
Gross!  How can he stand that
woman?
(louder)
Hey, cut it out!  I'm a child!
For God sakes!

The NOISE gets weirder.  Lydia gets interested.


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara moan and groan.  Delia doesn't stir.

BARBARA
I feel really stupid.

ADAM
It's not stupid.  We're ghosts.
Do you want this woman for
breakfast for 125 years?  Moan
louder!

Barbara moans louder and more weirdly.

Delia stirs, sits up, but doesn't open her eyes.

Adam and Barbara are excited then... disappointed as
Delia fumbles on the bedside table for the remote con-
trol device, and without opening her eyes, turns off
the television set.  Then she turns over, and is lost
to the world totally.

Barbara sighs.  She and Adam walk toward the door.
When they open it however, Lydia is standing there in
her pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam
and Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright.

LYDIA
Sick!  Sexual perversion!  If
you're going to do weird sexual
stuff you ought to stay in your
bedroom, okay?

Lydia starts back into her room.  Then looks at the
developing photograph.  Something catches her eye.

Lydia yelps with fear.

LYDIA
Holy cow!  No feet!

She screams.  Adam and Barbara scream.  Lydia rushes
back toward them, starts flashing pictures.

Adam and Barbara run around and are pushed into a
corner.  Polaroids fly everywhere.

Lydia runs out of film.  She stares at them, panting
with fear.  A standoff.

LYDIA
(continuing)
A... Are you the guys who're
hiding out in the attic?

ADAM
(fake terror voice)
We're ghosts.

Barbara moans.

LYDIA
(skeptical, cautious)
W... What do you look like under
there?

Adam and Barbara pull shut bedroom door, go out into
the hall -- as if to keep from waking Delia with their
conversation.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

All three stare at each other tentatively.

ADAM
Aren't you scared?

LYDIA
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren.
Those are sheets.  Are you gross
under there?  Are you ""Night of
the Living Dead"" under there?
Like all bloody veins and pus?

ADAM
What?

LYDIA
""Night of the Living Dead?""  It's
a movie.

BARBARA
(pulling off
the sheet)
If I had seen a ghost at your age,
I would have been frightened out
of my wits.

LYDIA
You're not gross.  Why were you
wearing a sheet?

BARBARA
We're practicing.

ADAM
You can actually see us?  Without
the sheets?

LYDIA
Is this like a trick question?

BARBARA
Tell the truth.

LYDIA
(offended)
Of course I can see you.

ADAM
Nobody else can.

LYDIA
I'm wearing contacts... Also I
read through the ""Handbook for the
Recently Deceased.""  It says that
live people ignore the strange and
unusual... I, myself, am strange
and unusual.

BARBARA
(tenderly)
You look like a regular girl to me.

Lydia blushes.  Barbara smiles warmly.  She is begin-
ning to like Lydia.

ADAM
You read our book?  Could you
follow it?

Lydia nods her head.

LYDIA
Why are you creeping around
Delia's bedroom?

ADAM
We were trying to scare your
mother.

LYDIA
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive
about being related to reptiles.

Barbara smiles.

LYDIA
(continuing)
You can't scare her.  She's
sleeping with Prince Valium
tonight.
(defiantly)
I stole the key to your attic, you
know.

Adam and Barbara look at each other.

BARBARA
Maybe we better talk.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

Adam's rigged up the moon, and stars, too.  Adam and
Barbara and Lydia stand just beyond the fringes of the
town, dimly lighted giants.

LYDIA
You did this?  You carved all
these little figures and houses
and things?

ADAM
(pleased)
I certainly did.  I'd finish it
too, but... I don't get out much.

LYDIA
And this used to be your house, I
bet.  Why do you want to scare
everybody?

ADAM
We want to frighten you away.
(a little embarrassed)
So that you'll move out.

LYDIA
You don't know the Deetz's very
well, do you?  My father bought
this place.  He never walks away
from equity.  Why don't you leave?

BARBARA
We can't.  We haven't left the
house since the funeral.

LYDIA
Funeral.  God, you guys really are
dead!
(fascinated)
What was it like?  The funeral.
Did you cry?

ADAM
We weren't there.  The handbook
says funerals aren't for the dead.

LYDIA
God, if this is true this is
amazing!  I kinda like it up
here.  Can I visit you sometimes?

ADAM
Well, I don't know... We don't get
many visitors.

BARBARA
You know you're really a pretty
girl.

Lydia flushes.

CHARLES (O.S.)
Lydia!

LYDIA
I better go...

BARBARA
Wait... I don't think it would be
a very good idea if you told your
parents that we're up here.

ADAM
Unless you think it would scare
them off.

Lydia starts to exit.

ADAM
(continuing)
You tell them that we are
desperate horrible ghoulish
creatures who will stop at nothing
to get back our house.

LYDIA
(looks him up
and down)
Wait a minute, what if this is a
dream?  Can you do any tricks to
prove I'm not dreaming?

Barbara shakes her head, a little ashamed.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Well, if you are real ghosts, you
better get another routine, those
sheets suck!

She sneaks a smile at Barbara and exits.


EXT. HOUSE - DAY

A big ugly machine is doing something unnecessary to
the yard.


INT. DARKROOM/BASEMENT - DAY

The FAST-TICKING CLOCK is a timer.  Lydia is making
Polaroid enlargements.  She's quick and expert at this.
She's examining a print with a magnifying glass.


INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY

Delia shrieks.  Going through the dirty clothes, she's
just come across the sheets with the eye holes in them.

DELIA
Lydia!  Lydia!  My hands are
shredded from doing the laundry,
and now I have to deal with your
vandalism!


INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia, pounding up from the basement with the wet
print, collides with Delia, rushing down from the sec-
ond floor with the scissored sheets.

DELIA
Lydia, honest to God I'm going to
kill you.  I'm having a party
tonight.  I'm cooking, I can't get
servants.  Do I need angst?  No, I
certainly do not!

Lydia speeds by her.

DELIA
(continuing)
You owe me three-hundred bucks,
Lydia!  Don't go running to your
father, you worm.


INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY

Lydia rushes in.  Charles is working furiously on a
word processor, amidst an array of maps and plans.

LYDIA
Dad.  Do you believe me?

CHARLES
Yes.  Except when you creep around
in your mother's --

LYDIA
Stepmother's...

CHARLES
... sheets.

LYDIA
Well this is... I mean, this is
the weirdest --

CHARLES
Lydia, I don't know what it is
with you and these pratical
jokes, but --

LYDIA
This is not a joke!  That sheet
was full of ghosts.

She hands him the photo.  He looks.  Lydia points
out...

LYDIA
(continuing)
No feet.

Charles laughs.

LYDIA
(continuing)
You don't believe me.  That sheet
was full of ghosts.  They live
here.

Charles begins to scroll through computer program.

CHARLES
(dismissing it)
Very clever, Lydia.  Now would you
please -- I'll tell you what... I
know!  You're bored, right?  You
take that camera and your bike
and photograph every building in
town.  Don't tell anyone what it's
for...
(handing her a
wad of bills)
Here, take some cash and go do
it.  How's that?  You want to
stretch, don't you?

Lydia exits, with determination.  Charles looks up on
the wall and runs his finger over a plat map of Winter
River, just like Adam's in the attic.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Look at the size of these lots...

Adam peers at the map, puzzled.

ADAM
What is this guy doing?

Barbara follows Lydia out.  Adam thinks, intrigued.
Exits.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Delia is frantically preparing for the evening's dinner
party.  Lydia is very much in her way, trying to show
her the photographs.  Delia isn't looking at them.

DELIA
I can't believe you are doing this
to me!  Ghosts.  I am giving a
dinner party for seven people
tonight.  Otho has agreed to come
back for the demolition of the
attic.  My agent, Bernard, is
bringing some woman who writes for
""Art in America.""  In fact, no one
here tonight has not been in
""Vanity Fair.""  Except you.

LYDIA
(resigned)
I told them you were too mean to
be afraid.

DELIA
Don't you dare talk to others
about me.  I'm an artist!  The
only thing that scares me is being
embarrassed in front of my
friends.  Do you know how hard it
is to get civilized people to set
foot in this part of Connecticut?
Not a solitary word of this
pubescent tripe to anyone.

Lydia exits angrily.

CAMERA HINGES.  Barbara is watching, horrified at
Delia's occupation of her (Barbara's) kitchen.  Adam
appears.

BARBARA
Lydia's trying, but they don't
believe her.

ADAM
She's got photos, Barbara.

BARBARA
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!

ADAM
This is different.  Eventually
she'll take someone to the attic.
And then what?  We've got to try
to contact this guy Betelmyer.  We
gotta get some help, hon.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - LATER - DAY

Adam looks intently through the book.

Barbara's eye is caught by something in the model
cemetery.  She moves over and sees a small gravestone
lit up by neon.

BARBARA
Adam!

Adam comes over.  Looks.

ADAM
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.

BARBARA
It's him.  Look... Betelgeuse...
Betelgeuse...

She looks at Adam, ""should I?"" Adam chews his lip
thoughtfully.

ADAM
Go ahead... third time's a charm.

BARBARA
(after a deep breath)
Betelgeuse!

ZAP!  They are transported into the model graveyard.


EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

WIND BLOWS --  With shovels and lanterns, Adam and
Barbara are unlikely gravediggers.  The mechanized
clouds move in the sky across the mechanical moon,
throwing weird shadows everywhere.  Ground fog creeps
slowly along the graves.  It is so eerie.

BARBARA
What happened?

ADAM
Three times.  Powerful number.

BARBARA
(standing in front
of grave)
Bet... el... geuse.  What an
awful name.  I thought it was like
-- you know.  The juice of
beetles.

Adam cringes too.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Where is he?  What do we do?

Adam looks down at the grave.  Knocks on the stone.
Nothing.

ADAM
Has anything been simple so far?
From the look of the shovel, we
dig.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.
My nails keep getting longer.
I'll break them.

Hands her a shovel anyway.  She digs.


EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - LATER - NIGHT

They're almost down six feet.  By now they are both
almost out of sight in the grave.  Inside the grave --
Adam suddenly hits wood.

BARBARA
It's about time.

They lean down and brush dirt off a brass plate on the
coffin.

""BETELGEUSE""

ADAM
I guess we open it.

BARBARA
Maybe we should knock first?

A slight TREMOR shakes them.  They look at each other
and try to scramble from the grave.


TOPSIDE

They just barely crawl out when a mouldering corpse
springs out of the grave and jumps on Barbara's back,
and plants a thousand-year-old kiss on her lips.  She
screams and burbles.  Adam pulls the corpse off her
back.  The corpse does a Three Stooges hammer on Adam's
head.

Adam staggers backward, unhurt but shocked.  All three
stop.


ON THE CORPSE

Something unreal about him, almost mechanical.  Then
the corpse, grinning insanely at them, flies straight
up into the air over their heads.  He CRASHES against
the tombstone...

And Adam and Barbara see the corpse is only a huge
marionette on a string and pole.  A LAUGH comes from
behind the gravestone.


PUPPETEER BETELGEUSE

steps out.  He looks like someone who just crawled out
from under a rock.  This is one slippery customer.
Betelgeuse speaks in a rapid polyglot, choosing words
and phrases from every slang in the world.  Barbara is
mighty uneasy.

BETELGEUSE
All right.  Who are you?

BARBARA
We're...

BETELGEUSE
You're the dead.

ADAM
Aren't you dead?

BETELGEUSE
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a
businessman.  I'm the man what
am.  Beeetel Jooose!  Who
do I gotta kill?

ADAM
You don't kill anyone.

BARBARA
Just get some people out of our
house.

BETELGEUSE
Bio busting.  I love it.  Who do
I gotta kill?  Family -- right?
Obnoxious, I bet.
(contorting face)
Mommie, daddy, piglets.

BARBARA
Just one daughter.

BETELGEUSE
Hey you've been on Saturn!
(brushing yellow dust
off her)
I hate those Sandworms!  Yecchhh!
I've lost a lot of buddies to
Sandworms.
(back to work)
So a daughter?  She got good legs?
God I love a young leg.

Air blows up Barbara's dress, exposing her legs.  He
leers.

BARBARA
She's only fourteen...

ADAM
... acts like she's thirty-five.

BETELGEUSE
(rubbing hands)
How does she feel about short old
men with dirty ears?

Barbara is grossed out and increasingly uneasy.  Beetle
Juice senses it and gets back to business.

BETELGEUSE
So you, the dead, want me, the
undead, to throw the live guys --
Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who
might not mind a tumble with an
older guy, out into the cold?
Even though they have paid hard
casharoonie for your dump?

ADAM
But... the Deetzes are destroying
our house.

BETELGEUSE
(scolding sarcasm)
You Maitlands are the backbone of
the afterlife.  So what's my cut?

ADAM
Can you scare them off?

Beetle Juice looks offended.

BETELGEUSE
Me, scary?  You be the judge.


ANGLE

He swirls his face and shoulders into a horrifying
image.  Pleased, he laughs at himself.

BARBARA
(decisively)
Honey.  Let's go.

ADAM
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need
help.

BARBARA
No, we don't.  We can work
something out ourselves.  We just
have to try harder.

BETELGEUSE
Hold on.  Let's not be squeamish,
missy.  You rang my bell, you
gotta lick the pump.  I'm rolling!


BARBARA

grabs Adam.  Betelgeuse is getting mad.  Not pretty.

BETELGEUSE
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at
your service.  You be the judge.
I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.

BARBARA
Home.  Home.  Home!


ZAP

They are gone.  Betelgeuse is furious.

BETELGEUSE
You fresh corpse creeps!  Who do
you think you are?... Walking
away from a professional?


BETELGEUSE

walks to a tree and kicks it hard.  The whole huge tree
falls, KABLOOM!


INT. ATTIC - DAY

A small tree falls in the model.  Adam, across the
room, walks over and straightens it.

He looks at Barbara who is poring over the handbook.
Making notes.  Counting out procedures.

ADAM
Honey, I think that was a mistake.

BARBARA
I am not going to expose that
little girl to that... pervert
down there.

ADAM
How'd you do that?

BARBARA
(proud of herself)
Just a hunch... remember things
come in threes -- three times in,
three times out... I'm getting the
hang of this stuff.

ADAM
I think we really pissed him off.

BARBARA
I don't care...

ADAM
But we let him out.

BARBARA
I've changed my mind... I feel
really confident.  We're getting
better at this stuff.  We can
scare them off ourselves --
tonight!  I've got an idea.
You're going to love it... I'm
going to hate it.


ADAM

turns to look down at the model again.  Straightens the
tree.  Turns away.  We can see a tiny light moving
through the tiny model forest towards the house.

ADAM (V.O.)
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure
seemed mad.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(singing)
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I
go!


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Dinner for seven, as promised.  Everything looks very
nice.  Deetzes are in control and in their element.
The element is neurotic-chic.

Some of the guests are affecting distaste for having
had to make the long drive to Connecticut.  There's a
bitchy feud going on between GRACE, the ""Art In Amer-
ica"" writer, and BERNARD, Delia's agent, that threatens
to become a full-scale war.

Otho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite
occupation -- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses
of his friends.  He's singled out his victim, BERYL,
the editor for Ballantine, a frail-looking woman who is
dressed ""artistically.""

OTHO
(to Beryl)
Well, darling, you can only have a
hysterectomy once, so why don't you
tell us what you really went into
the hospital for last week?  Or dare
I ask, is that a nose ""nouveau?""

CHARLES
(privately; to
Otho)
Otho, you've got to help me get
Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal
that could make all of us very
comfortable.

OTHO
He's a cloven-hooved beast!

CHARLES
He's your cousin.

OTHO
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look,
nothing short of giving away free
sacks of money would get him up
here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget
it.  You can't get her out of
Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
(still on Beryl's
case)
I just hope it wasn't yet another of
your dreary suicide attempts.  You
know what they say about people who
who commit suicide.  In the afterlife,
they become civil servants.

BERNARD
Otho!  I didn't know you were into
the supernatural?

OTHO
Of course you remember!  After my
stint with the living theatre.  I
was one of New York City's leading
paranormal researchers until the
bottom dropped out of the business
in '72.

BERYL
(sick to death of
this blowhard)
Paranormal... Is that what they're
calling your kind now?

Lydia watches Otho thoughtfully.  Suddenly very cur-
ious.

Delia senses that Lydia might talk ghosts here.

DELIA
(a threat; quietly
to Lydia)
Don't you dare.

LYDIA
I saw some ghosts.

All quiet.

DELIA
(interrupting)
Lydia tried to play a most
amusing joke on me this afternoon.

LYDIA
It wasn't a joke.

DELIA
Tried to convince me that this
house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids.
Kids!  I love them.

Otho's glance sharpens at this.  Everyone else listens.

GRACE
By ghosts?

LYDIA
By what else?

DELIA
(laughing it away)
In sheets yet.  Designer sheets.
They --

Charles, seeing things aren't going well for Delia,
proposes a toast.

CHARLES
I propose a toast to our intrepid
friends.  Who braved the
expressway and fourteen toll
booths to visit us.  May your
buildings go condo.

All lift their wineglasses.  All drink.  All synchro-
nously spit out their wine.  All together now...

EVERYONE
Yechhh!

Charles lifts the wine bottle from the cooler.  Disgust
spans the room.

ON bottle -- it bears the familiar spread wings of
Thunderbird!

BERYL
Thunderbird wine?  My God, Delia,
don't you even have a Safeway up
here?

DELIA
(horrified; but
recovering)
Joke Joke!  Charles get the good
wine and I'll serve the shrimp.
It's a joke.

Delia stares a spike through Lydia.  Delia and Charles
rush into the kitchen.  Otho looks at his glass and
peers at Lydia.


INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

Delia rushes to get the sushi.  Charles finds some
good wine.

DELIA
(rapidly; furious)
Lydia switched wines.  Charles --
if you do not agree right now, to
boarding school, you can forget
having what you call sex -- ever
again in your natural lifetime.

He nods reluctantly.  She rushes back to guests.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia is looking around curiously.  Delia and Charles
rush back in with sushi and good wine.  Delia pours for
Bernard, the obvious connoisseur.  He tastes the wine.
All wait.  Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.  All
smile.

Otho is more interested in Lydia's story.  He leans
toward her...

OTHO
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your
ghosts.

DELIA
No!  Do not encourage this
little... person.

OTHO
Oh, Delia, lighten up!

DELIA
She's been without therapy up here
and I will not allow her to
ruin...

But then:


DELIA

Something comes over her -- she straightens, then
crouches a little, her hand sweeps across in front of
her, almost mechanically.  And then our Delia Deetz,
unable to help herself, leaves the whitebread world
behind and possessed, sings in someone else's voice, a
rich, NEGRO TENOR.

DELIA
""If I didn't care, More than
words could say.""

Lydia's eyes widen.  MUSIC UP.  All the guests are
spellbound.

Charles, too, has the beat -- The Ink Spots in his eyes.
In a voice not his own.

CHARLES
""If my every prayer, did not
begin and end with just your
name.""

Delia is shocked.  She looks at Lydia.

DELIA
For God's sake, stop me...

She is cut short by her powerful inspiration.

DELIA
""I could not be true to you
beyond compare.""


ALL THE GUESTS

except Lydia, are possessed to become the chorus.  They
stand by their chairs, they spin in perfect Motown
choreography.

EVERYONE
(except Lydia)
""Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.""

DELIA
""If I didn't care... for you...""

EVERYONE
""Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.""

A look of sheer delight comes across Lydia's face,
unlike anything we have previously seen.  She dances
and claps her hands in time with the music.  She is in
teen heaven.

NOTE:  Delia and the guests are fully aware of their
singing/actions, but helpless to stop themselves.  While
it is funny, it is nevertheless just a little frighten-
ing.

Lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can
see the ghosts.  She can't.

Now the song pauses... Everyone tries to recover for a
shocked second.  Instead, the tempo changes.

As the tempo quickens, the guest/chorus is syncopated
like alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled
into their chairs.  They sing throughout.


THE SONG

crashes to its end.  Bernard looks down at his shrimp
cocktail.  The shrimp draped over the rice roll
suddenly rears up like a hand and, making a tiny fist,
grabs his dangling tie and... smash --

WIDER -- All the guests are punched by the shrimp, back
over their chairs to the ground.  They are stunned.
Suddenly everyone runs frightened into the next room.


EXT./INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara with huge smiles on their faces, dance
the bugaloo then hug and kiss on the landing in front
of the attic.  Door is open.

TOGETHER
We did it!

ADAM
Let's watch 'em scatter.

They enter the attic and run to the window.  Look out
over the front yard.


YARD OF HOUSE - THEIR POV - NIGHT

filled with the cars of the guests, as well as Delia
and Charles' vehicles.

ADAM (O.S.)
Any minute now.  They'll all run
screaming.


BACK TO SCENE

They wait.  Nothing moving outside.

BARBARA
Your Ink Spots were wonderful!

Adam smiles proudly.

ADAM
And your shrimp was remarkable.

BARBARA
My shrimp?  I did the wine.
Didn't you do the sushi?

ADAM
N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Who did the?

Timid KNOCK at the door of the attic.

Barbara glances at Adam.  They don't know what to do.

LYDIA
(from outside the
door)
It's me.  Lydia.

Adam, puzzled, goes to the door and opens it.  Lydia is
standing there, sheepish.

LYDIA
(continuing)
They'd like for you to come
downstairs.  Delia says you can
pick any sheets you want.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The guests are sitting expectantly.  The photographs
are being passed around.  The wheels are turning in
Charles' mind --  he sees a gold mine.  Everyone speaks
at once.

DELIA
It does indicate a marvelously
urbane sense of humor on the part
of these ghosts -- that they
actually appear in sheets!

OTHO
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn
here, a very sophisticated pair.  We
must protect them, treat them with
respect.  Nurture them.

CHARLES
People will pay big money for
this.  Right, Grace?

GRACE
(nodding)
Charles, I want to know why you
didn't tell me about this --

DELIA
(now changing her
tune)
We were waiting for proof.
Lydia's photographs...

Charles is scheming.

BERNARD
(skeptical)
What are you all talking about?
We... we just got a little drunk,
that's all.

OTHO
No matter how drunk you get, you
cannot sound like the Ink Spots.
(to Charles)
Charles, this is it!  You can get
Maxie Dean up here now.

Charles plots and plans.

OTHO
His wife Sarah loves the
supernatural.  I did a reading for
her just last week.  Told her her
jowls would tighten soon.  I mean
she will make him sprint up here in
his helicopter if you can produce
ghosts for her.

BERYL
The ""Enquirer"" has offered fifty
thousand dollars for absolute
proof of life after death.  I'll
send them over.

BERNARD
I'm Delia's agent!  I've lost
money for years on her work.  If
anything actually happened here,
I'll handle it, thank you.  But
not until I see some real proof.

Lydia appears at the base of the stairs.  Everyone
stops squabbling, looks at her expectantly.

LYDIA
They don't want to come down.

OTHO
Why not?

Bernard shakes his head as if all this were an elaborate
hoax.  He harumphs!

LYDIA
I think the reason is they were
trying to scare you, and you
didn't get scared --

DELIA
Of course we weren't scared.
(looking around)
Just a little startled.  One of
those shrimp dropped down my
Kamali.

Bernard is now convinced this whole business was a put-
on.

BERNARD
(shaking his head)
Total collective hallucination.

BERYL
I was a little tipsie.

DELIA
This was not a hallucination,
people.  This was real, really
totally real.

GRACE
Of course, they were rather
spectacular effects -- for
Connecticut, I mean.

OTHO
All presences have a home space.  A
place where they live, so to speak.
Where do they hide out?

LYDIA
(reluctantly)
The attic.

CHARLES
The attic room is locked --

LYDIA
They're ghosts.  They do what they
want.

OTHO
Fabulous!  Otho Fenlock's ""Locked
Door"" ghosts!  Probably committed
suicide up there -- hanging like
beeves from the rafters.  I'm
totally enchanted.

Bernard gathers Grace and Beryl and walks out the door.

BERNARD
Delia, you are a flake.  You have
always been a flake.  I'm packing
up and going back to the tricks of
the city.  That I can manage.  If
you must frighten people, do it
with your sculpture.

They exit.  Delia is horrified and embarrassed.

DELIA
Wait!  I'm going to get to the
bottom of this!  Lydia, is this
some high-tech trick of yours?  I
want you to take us up there tout
sweet!


INT. LANDING OUTSIDE OF ATTIC

Delia, Charles, Otho and Lydia -- creep, creep.

DELIA
(whispering)
Shhh.  They're in there?  God,
they live like animals.  This is
where they've been hiding out?

Lydia nods.  Delia suddenly, brashly pounds on the
door.

DELIA
(shouting)
All right, you dead people!  Come
on out, or we'll break down this
door and drag you out on the ropes
you hanged yourself with!

LYDIA
Shhhh.  They didn't commit
suicide.

DELIA
It doesn't matter.
What matters is I've got a roomful
of guests down there, who think
I'm a fraud.
(to Lydia)
I am going to teach you something
here Lydia.  You've got to take
the right tone in things like
this, or people -- whether they're
dead or alive -- people will walk
all over you.
(loud)
Come on out, or I will make death
so miserable that you will wish
you had never lived!

Delia pounds on door, which opens with an eerie CREAK.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is pushed in first.  She looks around.  Delia,
Charles and Otho come in next, carefully.  One by one
they straighten up and look around.

DELIA
(whisper)
So where are they, Lydia?

Lydia shrugs, looks around.

CHARLES
(off-handedly)
Answer your mother.

LYDIA
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts
are really nice people.  I think
we scared them off.  Let's just
leave them alone.  Okay?

Charles is suddenly transfixed.  He stares at the
model.

CHARLES
It's the whole damn town.

They gather around.  Lydia is a little sad as she looks
at the empty room and the model.

OTHO
Look at that detail!

DELIA
Look at the tiny figures.

CHARLES
Look at all that parking!

LYDIA
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.

OTHO
They're not here, Lydia?

She shakes her head.  Otho spots the handbook.  Palms
it.

DELIA
I have never been so
embarrassed... They haven't gone
for good, have they?

Delia is suddenly out the door, urging them all outside.

DELIA
(continuing)
Everyone out of there.  If they're
in there somewhere, I don't want
to scare them away.  Come on now,
stay out of there.  We've got work
to do.

Otho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits.
Delia carefully closes the door.


CAMERA EASES OVER TO THE WINDOW

We see two pairs of hands, white-knuckled, gripping the
window sill from the outside.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

Barbara and Adam are hanging outside the window.
CAMERA EASES BACK to see that instead of hanging from
the house --

They are hanging from a ledge over The Inferno --


ON INFERNO

circles of rosy hell.  Several devilish Monsters slaver
up at them, hoping for new meat for the furnace.  Small
geysers spurt foul gasses.


WINDS

BLOW hard on Adam and Barbara.  They struggle to hold
on and pull themselves back up and into the window.

ADAM
Juno, help!  Juno!

After nearly falling, Adam barely saves Barbara and
they finally make it up, and disappear into the window.


INT. ATTIC LANDING - NIGHT

Delia, Charles and Otho all start down the stairs, one
by one.  All are holding the handrail.

DELIA
Lydia, I will never forgive you
for embarrassing me in front of my
social inferiors.  You help us
with these ghosts or you'll be
sorry.

LYDIA
I'm sorry already.

CHARLES
(fixing on Otho)
Now, let's get back to business.  I
I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah
up here immediately.  I can make
history here!  I'm going to turn
this sleepy little backward town
into a leading supernatural
research center... and amusement
park.

LYDIA
(disgusted)
I cannot believe this.

CHARLES
Delia will cook...

Delia glares at him.

CHARLES
(continuing)
I'll bring the wine... and the
business plan.  And Lydia --
you'll bring the ghosts.

LYDIA
(frustrated)
I can't bring the ghosts.  They're
not here!

CHARLES
... Otho, could you actually... do
something with them?

OTHO
(pats the handbook
under his coat)
Perhaps... if I were properly
motivated...

LYDIA
That's slavery and murder.  You
don't know them.  They're nice
people!

POV -- down the handrail, as they walk downstairs.
Lydia lags behind, sullen.


LOWER END OF THE HANDRAIL

lifts, and turns.  The handrail has become a long, fat,
diamond-backed snake -- unlike any we have ever seen.
It flashes terrifying steel teeth and a red-feathered
comb.  It turns and HISSES at them.


ON DELIA

She screams as she looks down at her hand on the rail
-- it grips the scaly, throbbing, dripping body of the
snake.


THE SNAKE

just gets longer and nastier as it turns back in the
air, up the stairs toward them.  Its tail circles Delia
and spins her like a top.  When she stops -- the snake
gives her a big wet snake kiss.


SNAKE

snaps Otho in the behind.  It hurts.


THE SNAKE

rears up and spreads a red-comb and HISSES loudly.


ALL THREE

of them fall over each other trying to escape.


THE SNAKE

hovers horribly over them.  Grabs Charles in its coils
and squeezes him hard -- his fearful face reddens, then
it suspends Charles over the edge of the stairs.

SNAKE
We've come for your daughter,
Chuck!


HE

leers at Lydia and drops Charles like a rock over the
bannister.  Charles screams.


THE SNAKE

Grins at a terrified Lydia.


SNAKE

rears back for a strike, when suddenly, like thunder.
One word is heard.

BARBARA
Betelgeuse!  Betelgeuse!
Betelgeuse!


THE SNAKE

looks up with familiar eyes.  At top of stairs stands
an angry Barbara.

What happens next is almost too fast for the eye to
see.


THE SNAKE

shrinks and turns back into the regular mahogany hand-
rail.


BETELGEUSE

or his outline, whips up the stairs, through the door,
and is gone like a rocket.

BETELGEUSE
RRRatt shit!


OTHO AND DELIA

rush downstairs -- Lydia is terrified.  She runs away.

LYDIA
I hate you!  I thought you were my
friends.

BARBARA
No, wait!

Lydia screams and runs down the stairs.

LYDIA
(screams)
I hate all of you!

Slowly, Barbara returns to the attic.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Adam and Barbara are exhausted.  Agitated.

ADAM
Great choice we've got here.  We
get to spend the next century
either hanging out that window or
doing parlor tricks.

Adam is working with the model town.  Barbara is pac-
ing.

ADAM
Maybe they'll leave now.  That
snake was a pretty nasty customer.

BARBARA
He might have hurt somebody.

ADAM
But he didn't.  We've got him
where we want him.


ON THE MODEL

A column of water shoots high in the air.

Adam rushes over to the model -- looks down.


INT. MODEL - DAY

Betelgeuse has run a beat-up old pickup into a fire
hydrant.  He stands nearby, hopping mad; shakes his
fist at Adam.

BETELGEUSE
You pansy-assed cretins!  How dare
you do that to me.  I coulda
finished the job!


IN THE ATTIC

Barbara and Adam, obviously disturbed, look at one
another with concern.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(thin and pip-
ing voice)
Why did you stop me?

BARBARA
I don't like Charles Deetz
particularly, but you could have
killed him.

BETELGEUSE
Hey, I've been bottled up for six
hundred years.  Every dog has his
day.  This is my town.  I need a
night to howl.

ADAM
This is my town.

BETELGEUSE
You wish!  I nearly scored with
that little blonde.  I need me a
short little queen.


ANGLE

Angry, Barbara reaches down into the model and plucks
Betelgeuse up.

Barbara lifts him up toward her, squeezing him
slightly.

BARBARA
You leave her alone, you horrid
little prick!


CLOSEUP - BETELGEUSE IN BARBARA'S HAND

Betelgeuse grins.  Suddenly large spikes shoot out all
over his body, piercing the skin of Barbara's palm and
fingers.  Barbara's blood is a rich pink.

She squeals and releases the evil spirit and he plum-
mets.


EXT. MODEL - DAY

Betelgeuse lands on the town common.  Betelgeuse is
defiant.

BETELGEUSE
Go ahead.  Make my millenium!


ANGLE

We hear the tinny strains of ""Honky Tonk Angel"" as if
from down the street.  He turns around to follow it.

BETELGEUSE
This burg got a cathouse?  I'm
getting anxious if you know what I
mean.  Six hundred years and all.

He turns the corner to a whorehouse, with women --
women with demon horns -- hanging out of the window,
beckoning.  Betelgeuse rubs his hands together and
swaggers inside.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara aghast, watching this from above.

BARBARA
Adam!  Why did you build a whore
house?  Have you ever been to...?

ADAM
I didn't --


ANGLE

He doesn't finish -- a strong WIND blows through the
attic, nearly knocking Barbara and Adam over.  They
close their eyes against the gale.

When they open their eyes again, they're no longer in
the attic.  They're in --


INT. JUNO'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY

A cubicle in a much larger office.  Miss Argentina
swishes by.

RECEPTIONIST
God, you have got her steaming
now.

She exits.  There are other special workers.  The place
is really, really busy.  Adam and Barbara sit down to
wait.  Juno storms through with a sheaf of papers.  She
sees them.  She is steaming mad.

JUNO
The whorehouse was my idea.  I
want Betelgeuse out of the
picture!  We've got some serious
talking to do.

BARBARA
About what?

JUNO
You people have really screwed
up!  I received word that you
allowed yourselves to be
photographed.  And you let
Betelgeuse out and didn't put him
back, and you let Otho get ahold
of the handbook.

ADAM
Handbook?  When...?

JUNO
(continuing tirade)
Never trust the living!  We cannot
have a routine haunting like yours
provide incontrovertible visual
proof of existence beyond death.

ADAM
Well, we didn't know --


A BUNCH OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS

follow Juno like hungry dogs.

DUMB #1
Hey, Coach, where's the men's
room?

JUNO
(frustrated)
I'm not your coach.  He survived.

DUMB #2
You don't need a men's room.
You're not no man no more.  But
Coach, let me get this -- What's
our curfew over here?

They start squabbling.  Juno has to wrangle them into
another room.

JUNO
(frustrated)
I'll be right back.


INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Charles sits at the table with a small bandage on his
head.  Delia takes off her Gucci belt and whips it on a
chair absent-mindedly.

DELIA
I feel like we've been at war,
Charles.

CHARLES
At least insofar as we have our
first casualty.  Me.

DELIA
Otho'll know what to do.

CHARLES
What's he going to do?  Viciously
rearrange their environment?

DELIA
Otho knows just as much about the
supernatural as he knows about
interior design.

CHARLES
Let's hope he knows how to produce
those damn ghosts for Max and
Sarah... Because I've bought
options on property all over town.
I need Max's financing...

DELIA
Just don't tell Lydia.

CHARLES
Why not?

DELIA
I think she's in with them.

DISSOLVE TO:


INT. LYDIA'S BEDROOM - DAY

It's dark.  The bedroom curtains have been closed.
DRAMATIC OPERA MUSIC builds throughout.

Lydia melodramatically dressed in a long black dress
appears carrying a candle.  She is softly crying.

She sits at her dressing table, the candlelight shows
her writing paper.  She begins a very dramatic letter.

LYDIA
I am alone.

She looks at it and crumpling the paper, starts again.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I am utterly... alone.  You have
sealed my fate with your betrayal.
I can no longer stand to be used
like a puppet between two
deceitful worlds.  By the time you
read this, I will be gone, having
jumped off...

She scratches that out.

LYDIA
(continuing)
... having plummeted off the
Winter River Bridge.  Then you
will know that I am no longer a
toy in your petty feuds.  Goodbye,
Lydia.

A tear falls on the paper as she folds it and puts it
in an envelope.  OPERA MUSIC BUILDS AND CONTINUES.


INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY

Lydia slowly makes a copy of the suicide note.  The
green of the Xerox light falls eerily on her sad face.


INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Lydia at bottom of attic stairs.


LYDIA'S POV - STAIRS AND DOOR AT TOP

They look ominous.  She starts upward.


INT. ATTIC ROOM - DAY

The door opens and Lydia peers in.

The room is empty.  Lydia comes inside.

LYDIA
Are you here?

She hears SOMETHING.  Looks all around the room.
Nothing.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come
for the last time?
(laying note on
table)
Where are you?  Barb...

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
They're dead.

Lydia looks around, then peers into model.

BETELGEUSE (V.O.)
(continuing)
Think small.  I'm talking to you.


EXT. MODEL TOWN - BUILDING ROOF - DAY

A tiny Betelgeuse on the roof of a building, wearing a
silk dressing gown, looking like he just dragged him-
self out of bed.  One of the horned whores is nude,
sunbathing in the corner, and Betelgeuse drapes a
blanket over her.  Lydia's face looms enormous in the
sky.

BETELGEUSE
Cookie, they are dead, dead,
deadski.

LYDIA
Of course they're dead.  They're
ghosts.

BETELGEUSE
No, I mean they've gone.
Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.

LYDIA
Where'd they go?

BETELGEUSE
The happy hunting ground.  Who
cares?

LYDIA
Are you a spirit too?

BETELGEUSE
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh.
Listen, cookie, I've been trapped
in this burg for hundreds of
years.  All I want is to get out.

LYDIA
I want to get in.

BETELGEUSE
You do?  Over here?  On my side?

LYDIA
I think so.

BETELGEUSE
(scheming quickly)
Well, yes, of course.  It's great
over here.  You'll meet all the
greats.  James Dean.  Sid
Vicious...

LYDIA
Well, it can't be any worse than
my life here.

BETELGEUSE
(sinister, encouraging
her)
That's right.  They treat you like
scum, I bet?

LYDIA
Yeah.

BETELGEUSE
I can't help you from this side,
but here's how we do it.  So
simple.  Say my name three
times.  That's all.  I'll be all
yours.  Then I'll bring you over
here in style.

LYDIA
I... I don't know what your name is.

BETELGEUSE
Minor problem.  The rules.  I
can't tell it to you.  But.. do
you know how to play charades?

LYDIA
Yes.

BETELGEUSE
Of course you do.

He holds up two fingers in a V.

LYDIA
Two words.

Betelgeuse holds up one finger.

LYDIA
(continuing)
First word.

Betelgeuse puts two fingers on his arm.

LYDIA
(continuing)
Three syllables.

BETELGEUSE
No, dummy.  Two.

LYDIA
Your fingers are so small I can't
see them.  First word -- two
syllables.

He points behind her.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I don't know what that signal
means.

BETELGEUSE
It means look behind you, bimbo.


ANGLE

Lydia looks behind her.  A greet beetle the size of a
Volkswagen is crouching.  Its feathery antennae reach
out toward her menacingly.  Lydia yelps.

LYDIA
Beetle!

BETELGEUSE
Good girrrl!

POP!  The beetle disappears.  Betelgeuse holds up two
fingers.

LYDIA
(still shaken)
Second word.  Be careful.


ANGLE

Apprehensive, she jumps when a simple carton of orange
juice materializes.  Orange juice pours out into a
ghostly glass.

LYDIA
Breakfast?  Orange?

The orange juice disappears.  He shakes his head.

LYDIA
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle
fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit Battle?
Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?

BETELGEUSE
Good thing you are a beautiful
kid.  You are dumb!

Betelgeuse does the signal for ""Now Put Them Together.""

LYDIA
I am not!  Beetle... Juice?

BETELGEUSE
(jumping with delight)
That's it!

LYDIA
Your name is Beetle Juice?  Yecch!
That's as bad as Deeelia Deeetz.

BETELGEUSE
It's spelled different, but
basically... Now you said it
twice, just one more time.  And
I'll be free.
(sinister)
And then you'll be free.

Lydia, puzzled, gets the magnifying glass and peers at
him.


ON HIS UGLY FACE BIG IN THE GLASS

Betelgeuse jumps in the air, his robe parts -- we don't
see anything, but maybe Lydia does.

LYDIA
God, you're anatomically correct!

BETELGEUSE
Just say it.

LYDIA
(recognizing something
about him)
You were the snake!  Right?  I
know.  It was you.

BETELGEUSE
You've got to say it!

LYDIA
No I don't.  I don't take orders
from Smurfs.

BETELGEUSE
How'd you like to be married to...
the King...?

Lydia doesn't get it.

BETELGEUSE
(continuing)
... Elvis?...
(boasting)
You know, ever since he came over
he and I have been just like this.
(crosses his fingers)
I can arrange it.  Just say my
name one more time.

She thinks about that one.  Shakes her head.

LYDIA
No, No... I need to talk to
Barbara.

Betelgeuse smiles.

BETELGEUSE
Well, cookie, just say my name.  I
can get her.
(rubbing his horny little
hands together)
That and so much more...

Lydia walks around thinking for a moment.

LYDIA
Who else did you say is over
there?


INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY

Juno staring at them, hard.

JUNO
Yes... or no?  Do you want the
Deetzes out or in?

ADAM
Out.

BARBARA
What about Betelgeuse?

JUNO
Forget him.  He'll remain with his
whores until someone calls him.
You need to worry about people like
Otho.  There are a lot of
phony trance mediums.  They
usually can't make the formulas
work, but if Otho stumbles on the
right words in that handbook... he
could hurt you.  As in --
exorcism.

They both look puzzled.

JUNO
(continuing)
In plain English -- that's death
for the dead.  I don't care what
it takes, just get them out of
there now.  It's not pretty, but
-- that's death!

Adam stands to go.

JUNO
(continuing)
Wait a minute.  Let's see what
you're going to do...

They look at Juno.

JUNO
(continuing)
... to scare her.  I want to make
sure it's not some silly parlor
trick.

Barbara looks at Adam.

ADAM
I'll do the hard part, hon.


ADAM

reluctantly pulls on his face, and contorts it into a
living, breathing, horror.  Juno is even a little
repulsed.

JUNO
Not bad.  Not bad.  Now you?  Go
ahead.


ANGLE

She reluctantly does with her face a minor version of
Adam's horror.

JUNO
(continuing)
Okay.  You look great!  Now go
clean house.  And don't forget the
photographs and the damned
handbook.


ANGLE

Barbara and Adam slowly stand and walk out the door.
Barbara/Monster looks back pleadingly.  Football
players flood into Juno's office.  One PARTICULARLY
DUMB PLAYER has a revelation.  (He's pretty grisly,
maybe sat too close to the engine.)

PARTICULARLY DUMB PLAYER
Coach!  Coach, I don't think we
survived the crash!

Barbara and Adam look at each other and continue out the
door.


OUTSIDE JUNO'S OFFICE

They enter a long dark hallway.  They suddenly find
themselves standing in front of Lydia's room.  Adam/
Monster looks at Barbara/Monster as he grabs the door-
knob.  She stops him.  Tears fall down her sad ghostly
face.

BARBARA
Adam.  I can't do it.  I like that
little girl.

ADAM/MONSTER
It's too late.  Sometimes things
just work out this way.  We have
to, honey.

BARBARA/MONSTER
No we don't.  We can rebel or
something.  We'll just stay up
there in our room.  I'll read, you
can build on the model.  Come on.

She rushes up the stairs, toward the attic.  He follows
her.

ADAM/MONSTER
Wait.  We can't, honey.  Our
house...

She gets to the door.  Grabs the handle.

BARBARA
I want to be with Lydia!

She throws open the door.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Lydia is standing over the model, about to say
Betelgeuse's name.

LYDIA
Okay.  Beetle... J...

Barbara/Monster, horrified, screams!

BARBARA/MONSTER
!  Lydia, stop!

Adam/Monster runs to grab her.  Lydia is terrified.
Screams.

ADAM/MONSTER
No, don't say it!

BETELGEUSE
Say it!  Rat shit!

Betelgeuse slips off the roof into a patch of thorny
bushes.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Lydia screams, Adam/Monster tries to calm her.  Lydia
struggles and, thinking she is being attacked, runs out
the door.  Smack into Barbara/Monster.

Barbara catches her, frightens Lydia even more.
Barbara holds onto her as she struggles.  Barbara/
Monster slowly changes back into regular Barbara.
Lydia sees who it is and she hugs her.  Like mother and
daughter.

ON ADAM - slowly returning to himself.  He smiles
slightly at the scene.

BETELGEUSE (O.S.)
You lily-livered bleeding hearts!

BARBARA
I'm so sorry we frightened you.
What were you doing?

LYDIA
He... Beetle Jui...

Barbara quickly puts her hand over her mouth.

LYDIA
(continuing)
He said if I let him out he would
take me over to the other side to
find you.

BARBARA
No, Lydia, we're dead.

LYDIA
I want to be dead, too.

BARBARA
(shocked)
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?

LYDIA
(after a pause,
dramatically
but for real)
Life is just... unliveable...

Barbara hugs her.  She fumbles for words.  This is an
unusual situation, a dead person talking a live person
out of killing herself.  She rocks Lydia a little.
Barbara looks at Adam.

BARBARA
Lydia, believe me... we know...
all the hard stuff is the same
over here.  You're going to be who
you are... whether you're alive or
dead... and over here -- it's...
It's flat... there's no food, no
colors... you can't smell the
flowers.
(thinking)
If we knew then what we know
now... we'd have been more
careful...

ADAM
(in the style of the
dead receptionist)
... we wouldn't have had our
little accident.

Lydia looks at Barbara lovingly.

BARBARA
So never let Beetlejuice out --
never.  Besides...
(looking at Adam)
We're thinking about letting
everyone stay... you and your
father and mother can stay too.

LYDIA
(smiles and says
slowly)
Step... mother.


ADAM/MONSTER

is not sure, huffs around a little.  He is trying to
change back into Adam, except for his nose, which
remains like a beak for a minute.  Finally, it changes
too.

Lydia and Barbara laugh at him.


ANGLE

Without noticing Lydia, Otho and Charles push in
through the door and grab the model.  They take it out
the door.

Adam is beside himself.  Doesn't know what to do.

Barbara stops him from taking action.

ADAM
What is going on?

LYDIA
Really.  I don't know.

Adam looks suspiciously at her.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I really don't.  I'll go find out.

She runs out the door.

BARBARA
Be careful.


INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Lydia runs through the hallway and into the dining
room.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia walks into a presentation in progress.  Sitting
around the table are Otho, Maxie, and Delia.  Sarah Dean
is there, too.  She looks around Lydia hoping for
ghosts.  Sarah is heavily made up, smells bad.

Lydia's photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and
standing on a nearby easel.  Charles, over the model
with a pointer, is lost in mid-sentence.

CHARLES
-- In short, I've got options to
buy enough of Main Street to
control the city council for a
hundred years.  And at the prices
I'm talking about, if it all fell
apart tomorrow, we just move out and
sell to the Arabs and we still come
out... I've talked to Ed Cornwall
about a wax museum, here... in
Thanksgiving Park... Ed's the man
who made the talking Jesse Jackson
statue.
And I've got a museum dedicated to
50 Great Moments in the Paranormal
-- and parenthetically, D-Con wants
to the right to start an insect zoo
here in the old hardware store.
(seeing Lydia)
Lydia, did you finally decide to
join us?

They all give her an oily smile.

CHARLES
Honey, I am just finishing the first
phase presentation about our little
project here.  Then we'll take a
stretch and invite our friends... to meet
your friends.

Sarah gets Maxie's attention and unable to contain her
excitement, silently urges him to get on with the
ghosts.

SARAH
Are they here yet?

MAXIE
Yes, Charles, let's cut the
bullcorn.  We're here to see
ghosts.  This whole ghost town
museum and such like follows a
train, if you've got the engine...
so let's see your goddamned engine.

Everyone looks at Lydia.

LYDIA
They're... not here anymore.

CHARLES
(smiling apologetically)
Nonsense, every time she says
that, the paint peels, and some
wild creature tries to kill us.

SARAH
(motioning)
We've got these pictures, Lydia.

LYDIA
No, really... they said they might
come back and all of us could live
in peace if you agreed not to
tease them or make them do silly
tricks.

Sarah is disappointed.  She goes to Maxie.  Delia takes
over.

DELIA
She's become a little emotional
about all this.  No counseling up
here.  But we aren't relying on
her.  No, we rely on
professionals.  We have... Otho.

The whole room turns to Otho.  Who is scribbling some-
thing and mumbling.

CHARLES
Are they still here, Otho?

Otho looks up; he missed the question.

DELIA
Are they still here, Otho?

OTHO
Oh, they're still here.  They're
just not showing up.

CHARLES
They're probably guilty about what
they did to me.

DELIA
Not these people!  They are
ruthless!

MAXIE
I don't care from guilt.  I just
want to see them.

CHARLES
Otho, can you do it?

OTHO
It's tricky, but I think I can
handle it.

He dramatically produces the handbook.

LYDIA
No!

Lydia begins to think about this scene and she shifts
to another point of view.

LYDIA
Wait a minute!  What am I worried
about?  Otho, you can't even
change a tire!

OTHO
(taking the challenge)
I'll need something personal of
theirs.

LYDIA
You'll have to go to the Goodwill.

Delia gets an idea.


EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT

The moon stares down icily through gray clouds.  Wind
up.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Barbara is looking out the window.

BARBARA
(wistful)
You know, I've been thinking.  I
could teach Lydia to sew.

ADAM
Little black party dresses?

BARBARA
(punching him playfully)
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything
about little girls.  She's just...
missed out on some love, that's
all...

ADAM
(huffy)
Let's see if she can get my model
back.

BARBARA
You can build another one... with
her.

Adam isn't convinced.  Barbara motions him to sit next
to her.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Come here, I want to talk to you.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Delia carefully brings out a big plastic bag.  Lays
something out on the dining room table.

DELIA
I'm deeply sentimental about...
weddings.

Lydia stands to see:  Delia carefully lays out
Barbara's white wedding dress.  Then next to it, Adam's
wedding tux.

Lydia looks at it.  A chill runs through her.

LYDIA
(hushed realization)
Their wedding clothes.

OTHO
(dramatically)
Their wedding clothes.

Otho then holds up the handbook.

SARAH
The ""words"".

Otho nods.


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia is nervous now.  Otho lights a candle and Delia
turns out the lights.

OTHO
Hands vermillion / start of five
bright cotillion / raven's dive
nightshades promise / spirit's strive,
to the living / let now the dead...
come alive.

Nothing happens.  Lydia nervously turns away.

LYDIA
(sarcastically)
Doo wah.


ANGLE

Then a SIZZLE, a TINY CRACKLE, along one side of the
square.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

Barbara with her arm on his shoulder, talks to Adam.

BARBARA
We've been given a gift here,
honey.  A real live little girl.
She likes us a lot.  She needs
us.  Maybe that's why we died so
young, to keep us from getting
so... attached to things.  The
house, antiques, your model.  Look
at us.  We didn't have room for
anyone.

ADAM
(after a long thought)
What makes you think she likes me?

Barbara slowly smiles.  He does too.

He turns to Barbara.  CAMERA HINGES WITH him to see --


ON BARBARA

Her face is frightened.  She cannot speak.  She reaches
out to him -- but is disappearing.  He reaches for her
but she is suddenly -- GONE.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Varicolored lightning bolts shoot from every corner of
the square.  A gasp from everyone but Lydia.


ON LYDIA -- she is looking away.  She turns to see:


ON THE DRESS

Barbara's wedding dress floats over the table and fills
slowly, painfully, with the arms, legs and finally the
frightened face of Barbara.  A lightning bolt flares.

Lydia rises slowly to her feet, unable to resist.

More lightning bolts.

OTHO
As sudden thunder / Pierces the night;
As magic wonder / Mad affright
Rives asunder / Man's delight:
Our ghost, our corpse and we
Rise to be.

Lydia walks slowly toward Barbara.


ON BARBARA

She is in pain, she is very slowly aging.  She speaks,
but no words can be heard.  Not even by Lydia.  But we
can see she is calling for... Adam.

LYDIA
Stop it!

MAXIE
Shhhh!

Lydia screams for Adam.

LYDIA
Adam.  Adam.

OTHO
(louder)
As flies the lizard / Serpent fell;
As goblin vizard, / At the spell
Of pale wizard, / Sinks to hell;
The buried, dead, and slain...
Rise again.


INT. ATTIC - NIGHT

In a lightning flare we see: Adam searching for
Barbara.  He rushes out into the hallway.

ADAM
Barbara!  Barbara?  Ba...

His last plaintive call becomes mute as he too begins
slowly to disappear.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

On each of the watchers one by one, scared but
delighted too.  No one is watching Lydia.

ON LYDIA -- tears well up in her eyes.


ON BARBARA

She is slowly aging.  Now a bewildered Adam appears,
floating in his wedding suit.  Seeing his Barbara, now
older than he is, Adam reaches for her hand...

ON HANDS -- as he grasps her hand, it seems to be made
of white crepe; it wrinkles and nearly collapses.

Adam... puzzled, calls her name silently.

DELIA
What's happening to them?

OTHO
I don't know.

CHARLES
Are they suffering?

LYDIA
(screams)
They're dying.

MAXIE
They're already dead.  They can't
feel a thing.

Obviously not true.

ON BARBARA -- she looks down slowly at Lydia and with
effort makes a loving smile.  She reaches out toward
Lydia.

Completely helpless now, Lydia weeps openly and then
something comes over her.  She rushes across the room.
Stares down at the model.

LYDIA
Where are you?  Help us!  Please.
Betelgeuse!

A CRACK OF LIGHTNING.


EXT. MODEL TOWN GRAVEYARD - NIGHT

Someone, or something, like the figure of death in the
Goya drawing, is perched atop the gravestone of Barbara
and Adam Maitland.  The graves beneath him are open.
The figure turns... it is Betelgeuse.  He is filing his
talons casually.

He speaks with a ghastly rasp.

BETELGEUSE
So... You're ready for me now?

LYDIA
You've got to help them.

BETELGEUSE
Can you help me?

LYDIA
(frightened)
... I will.

BETELGEUSE
Then I'll help them.  For a price.

He grins.

LYDIA
W... What is it?

BETELGEUSE
(his words echo
horribly
Be... my... queen!

LYDIA
(repulsed)
Your qu...?  But you're...

BETELGEUSE
(smiling devilishly)
I'm beeyoo-teeful.


ON LYDIA

She is chilled.  Steps back.
She turns back to the Maitlands who are continuing to
age.  Looks back to the model.

LYDIA
... All right... Betelgeuse...


ON BETELGEUSE

He doubles in size.  The tombstone crumbles beneath
him...

LYDIA (V.O.)
(louder)
Betelgeuse...


WIDER ON GRAVEYARD

He doubles in size again.


ON LYDIA

She hesitates.


ON BETELGEUSE - TIGHT

He looks up at her confidently.

LYDIA
Betelgeuse!


DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara and Adam's corpses are nearly at the end of
their ropes.

CHARLES
All right, that's enough.  Can you
stop this now?

Otho doesn't answer.

CHARLES
(continuing)
Otho?

OTHO
It's too late, Charles.  I'm
sorry.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia peers at the model.  Betelgeuse is transforming.
There's a LOW RUMBLE.  The model town starts to shake.


INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

Lydia backs away.  Betelgeuse's head, now human-size,
rises from the center of the model town.


TIGHT ON HIS FACE

His grin is malevolent and malicious.  It's showtime,
folks!

BETELGEUSE
Attention, K-Mart shoppers!


ON DEETZES

-- who have been focused on the Maitlands now turning
around to the model.


ON MODEL

Betelgeuse begins a bright but sinister Carnival
Barker's pitch.  His shoulders now are clearing the
model.

BETELGEUSE
Welcome to Winter River!


ANGLE

Sarah rushes over to the model, thinking this is more
of the show.  Maxie follows.

BETELGEUSE
Hel LO Piggies!  Welcome to Winter
River!  See the Museum of Natural
Greed.  The Monument to Bored
Businessmen!  Come closer!


ANGLE

Suddenly Betelgeuse's arms elongate, swell and CRACKLE.


ON MAXIE AND SARAH

Their eyes grow wide.


TIGHT ON BETELGEUSE'S HANDS

They split, unfurl, and transmutate into two, shiny,
huge sledgehammers.


ON BETELGEUSE

He grins, his eyes sparkle in anticipation.  CARNEY
MUSIC UP.

BETELGEUSE
(roughly to the tune
of ""Santa Claus is
Coming to Town"")
You better not sell, you better
not buy...


ON MAXIE AND SARAH

Behind each of them, a graduated CARNIVAL BELL RINGING
GAME STANDARD erects itself.


ON BETELGEUSE

BETELGEUSE
(still singing)
Or old Uncle Beetle Claus will be
makin'... you... fly.

Betelgeuse swings his hammer/hands and sends Max and
Sarah zooming through the roof.  GONG.  GONG.


ANGLE

BETELGEUSE
(in style of game
show host)
Yowser, yowser.  Well, who do we
have here tonight?


ANGLE

He looks up at the suspended Maitlands.

BETELGEUSE
Let's have a hand for the
Maitlands, Barbara and Adam.  They
deserve a rest.


ON MAITLANDS

Wispy shadows by now, but still alive/dead.  They fall
in a heap on the floor.  NOTE:  They immediately start
to regenerate themselves.

BETELGEUSE
Well, we'll get back to them after
they recover from their flight.


ON ADAM

Filling out again, he struggles to stand, but falls.
Barbara shakes her head, trying to regain her focus.

BETELGEUSE
(looking around)
My God, what ugly wall dressing.
Who is responsible for all this
ugliness?
(spying Otho trying
to hide)
Otho, it's you!  Watch out for the
taste patrol!


ANGLE

He waves and the door opens.  A little Italian gentle-
man appears.

OTHO
No.  Noooo!  My God.  It's Giorgio
Armani!

GIORGIO
Before youa getta started herea, I
joost wanta to saya, Otho,
don'ta weara my stuff?  Okay?
Youa too fat for human-type
clothes.  Ita makes my designs
looka like aircraft covering!


ANGLE

Otho is horrified.  Suddenly he looks down and sees his
clothing has transformed into a polyester nightmare.
He runs out the door screaming.  Betelgeuese laughs
with delight then focuses on Lydia.

BETELGEUSE
Let's leave this crazy world
behind us.  I'll take you out in
style!

Sound of eerie WEDDING MARCH.  The fireplace changes
into an expressionist altar.


ANGLE

His leering horned whores walk like bridesmaids, in
step, through the door.  They rush toward Lydia.


ANGLE

Frightened, Lydia is assaulted and pulled forward by
these ugly handmaidens; she suddenly looks down and
sees she is now clothed in a blood-red wedding dress.
Lydia screams!!

BARBARA
No... No!

Adam's eyes widen.

LYDIA
(frightened, but
hurling the incan-
tation to make him
disappear)
No... Betelgeuse.  Bet...

Betelgeuse waves a hand and Lydia's mouth freezes.
Delia and Charles plead with the recovering Maitlands.

DELIA
(frantic)
Please, can't you do something!
Please!



ON BARBARA AND ADAM

Adam, not fully recovered, heroically tries to speak --
but his jaw falls off.  An exhausted Barbara tries to
help him reattach it.

Betelgeuse looks at Lydia.

BETELGEUSE
You know if we're going to get
married, we're going to need
witnesses!

Betelgeuse shifts his glare to Charles and Delia.
From Behind, Delia's horrid sculptures come to life
and attack Charles and Delia.  The sculptures twist
around them, forcing them to watch the hideous
spectacle.

Adam and Barbara are rapidly trying to recover as the
ceremony begins.


A DEATH-MASKED OLD PREACHER

slides down the fireplace, ready to perform the
service, speaks with a hissing death rattle.

PREACHER
Do you, Betel...

His mouth drops and is frozen.

BETELGEUSE
Uh-uh!  No one says the B word!

PREACHER
Do you, _____________, take this
woman to be your wedded wife?  To
honor...

BETELGEUSE
(interrupting)
You betcha!

Lydia screams and struggles.

PREACHER
And... you?  Do you, Lydia, take
this man?... er, uh... man... to
be your lawful wedded husband?...
In sickness...

Lydia struggles.  Her screams are muffled and distant.
Betelgeuse grabs her and shakes her.

BETELGEUSE
You don't have to answer him,
snookums.  I'll do it for you.
(eerily, speaking in
her voice)
I'm Lydia Deetz and I'm of sound
mind.  The man next to me is the
one I want.  You asked me... I'm
answering.  Yes.  How I love that
man of mine.

Adam, now fully regenerated, moves toward them.  He
shouts the incantation.

ADAM
Beetle...


ANGLE

Betelgeuse turns to him and with a sweep of his hand,
Adam's teeth (as if they were false), fly out of his
mouth and CLATTER to the floor.  Adam, toothless,
musters up his ghost powers and --

ON TEETH - TIGHT -- they rare back and continue
shouting...

TEETH
Beetleju...


ANGLE

Mayhem breaks out.  A furious Betelgeuse stomps at them
with his feet.  The teeth scuttle under the model.

BETELGEUSE
(angrily, to old man)
Now move it, pops!


ON ADAM

Speechless, Adam heroically charges toward Betelgeuse,
ready to strike him.  Betelgeuse spins on him and waves
his hand.  SOUND OF RUSHING WIND.


ON ADAM

He has been zapped into his model town.


ANGLE

Barbara screams and jumps at Betelgeuse.

BARBARA
Beetlegeuse...

Betelgeuse turns on her, eyes flashing.


ON BARBARA

A gag comes over her mouth.


ON MODEL

Adam is running around the streets trying to get out of
the model.  He looks up into the sky, sees a red glow
and THUNDERING WEDDING MUSIC.  He doesn't know what to
do.


ON BARBARA

She tears away her face (like tissue) and tries to say
his name again...

BARBARA
Betelgeuse...


ON BETELGEUSE

More angry, he waves his hand.


ON BARBARA

Her lips are zippered shut.


IN MODEL

Desperate, Adam gets an idea.  He runs over to the
truck Betelgeuse had crashed earlier, jumps in and
tries to start it.


ON BARBARA

She unzips her mouth and tries again.

BARBARA
Be


ON BETELGEUSE

Fire darts from his eyes....


ON BARBARA

A chromium steel plate is riveted across her mouth.
She screams wordlessly behind it.


IN MODEL

Adam finally gets the truck started.


BARBARA

Struggling with her mouth, frustrated to the breaking
point, she looks all around the room and rushes to the
window and CRASHES through into the night.


IN MODEL

Adam sees Barbara rush out.  He looks back at
Betelgeuse, floors the gas pedal and goes for one last
shot.


BETELGEUSE

BETELGEUSE
(angry)
Now, let's get rolling!

PREACHER
Then, by the authority vested in
me by...

A RUMBLE comes from outside.  Everyone notices but the
Preacher.  He stutters to finish the wedding.

BETELGEUSE
By me!  Get on with it!

LOUDER NOISE from outside.  Now nearly DEAFENING.

PREACHER
Yes... by him.  I now pronounce
you man and...


ANGLE

The truck is racing up to Betelgeuse's foot.  Adam
bails out just in time as the truck hits Betelgeuse's
foot and EXPLODES, giving him a distracting hot foot,
then --


ON WINDOW

Through it -- amidst a cloud of yellow dust -- CRASHES
the sand worm.  Barbara rides him bareback.  Barbara
struggles to control the ROARING worm.  She pulls on
his ears and looks around for Beetle Juice.  Seeing
him, she spurs the Worm after Beetle Juice.


ANGLE

Beetle Juice struggles, trying to run from the worm.
But Barbara and the worm outmaneuver him, corner him,
and when the worm reaches him, he opens his hungry
mouth and gulps Betelgeuse in one mouthful.

BETELGEUSE
Rrrrat shit!


ANGLE

Barbara leaps off, as the Sand Worm continues down
through the floorboards of the house

Betelgeuse is gone.  Adam is back to full size.
Charles and Delia are no longer held by the sculptures.
Lydia runs back to her family and Adam and Barbara.
The dust settles.


ON HOLE - JUNO

peers into the room.  She pulls the whores through the
hole.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN:

EXT. MAIN STREET - WINTER RIVER - A BRIGHT DAY

BIRDS SING.  Ernie polishes the lion.  Old Bill sleeps.
People stroll.


EXT. MISS SHANNON'S BOARDING SCHOOL - DAY

A lovely white boarding school with long, green lawn.
A BELL RINGS.  Girls come out the front door.  Say
goodbyes.  Lydia walks out too, carrying books.

LYDIA
'Bye, Serena.  See you later.

Lydia walks along Main Street of Winter River.


EXT. JANE BUTTERFIELD'S ANTIQUES/TRAVEL/REAL ESTATE

Jane is getting out of her car -- Little Jane follows.

JANE
Hellooo!  How's school?

LYDIA
(not particularly
interested)
It's okay.  How's the dirt
business?

JANE
Well, I'm expecting a call from
your parents.  I have some news
for them.

Jane hears PHONE RING from inside, rushes in to answer it.

LYDIA
Tell them I'll call them tonight.


EXT. MAIN STREET - WINTER RIVER - A BRIGHT DAY

Ernie polishes the lion.  Lydia passes.

LYDIA
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

He looks around, surprised.


INT. JANE BUTTERFIELD'S ANTIQUES/TRAVEL/REAL ESTATE

Jane screams into the phone.

JANE
What do you mean no?  After all
I've done for you.  I don't do
this for my health you know.

CAMERA EXPLORES a row of photographs of houses for
sale.

ON PHOTOGRAPH -- of the old Maitland house.  It is
delapidated and haunted-looking.  A legend reads:
Fixer-Upper's Special.""

BACK TO JANE -- she is frustrated.

JANE
I have here a bona fide offer of
$250,000.00 for that dump.

Little Jane is now at the Xerox machine.  The NOISE
irritates Big Jane and she throws a wad of paper at
Little Jane.  Little Jane gets mad and throws her
papers into the air and exits.


INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

We recognize the furniture.  It's the Deetzes'.  Delia
is on the phone to Jane.  Charles comes in with the
Wall Street Journal.  He fidgets, taps his fingers, as
he reads and pours coffee -- all at once.

DELIA
(whisper to Charles)
It's Mrs. Butterworth again.

Charles picks up the extension.

CHARLES
Listen to me, Jane.  We don't want
anyone looking at the house.  We
don't want it painted, the yard
mowed, the trees trimmed, nor do
we want it termite inspected.
It's not for sale.


INT. JANE'S STORE - DAY

Jane listens.  Silent.  Thinking.

JANE
Well.  Okay for now.  When will
you sell it?


INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY

DELIA
(smiles)
Never, honey.  Never.

She hangs up.  Looks at Charles.

DELIA
(continuing)
Some people never know when to
leave things the way they are.

Charles smiles.


INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

SOUND OF SWEEPING -- CAMERA eases up -- Barbara is
sweeping.  Adam working on his model.

ADAM
What time is it?

BARBARA
3:30 I guess.

ADAM
Give or take a year.

Barbara smiles.

The KITCHEN DOOR SLAMS.  Barbara looks up at Adam.
They smile.

ADAM
Did you get the paint?

LYDIA'S VOICE
I got it.  And I took pictures of
the new church for you, too.

BARBARA
How'd you do on the science test?

ON LYDIA

LYDIA
(hangs her head)
It was gross.  They wanted me to
dissect a frog.  I told them no
way.  I said it was against my
religion.  I got a C.

Adam frowns a little.

BARBARA
How did you do on the math test?

Lydia looks down coyly.

ADAM
We studied all day yesterday.
Don't tell me...

LYDIA
I got an A!

They grin with pride.

LYDIA
(continuing)
So can I?

ADAM
(shaking his head)
Uh-uh.  Only if you got above a C
on science.

LYDIA
Oh, go on...

BARBARA
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You
never got an A in science in your
life!

ADAM
All right.

ON LYDIA -- she puts down her books.  Loosens her
collar, ruffles her hair and waits.

ADAM
(continuing)
Okay.

Lydia looks down.  Lydia begins to levitate.

She lifts her head and leaves the white bread world
behind!  In a voice as deep and soulful as Percy
Sledge:

LYDIA
""When a man loves a woman.
He can't keep his mind on nothin' else.""

Behind her ghostly images of the football players
appear as back-up.

FOOTBALLERS
Oooooo.  Hummm oooooo.

LYDIA
He'd change the world for the good
thing he's found.  When a main
needs a woman, He cain't keep his
mind on nothin' else.  If she's
bad, he won't see it, she can do
no wrong.

MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:


ANGLE

A great pile of sand with the whorehouse in the
middle.  An irritated Betelgeuse crawls out on the
roof.  Hating the singing he shakes his fist at the
sky -- loses his footing and tumbles into the sand.
Terrified, he scrambles to get out.


ON PILE

A moving coil under the sand sends him scurrying inside
again.  The Sandworm SNAPPING right behind him as he
runs back out on the roof.


ANGLE

CAMERA TILTS UP to see house.  It is the perfect, New
England house.  CAMERA PULLS BACK from the model -- out
the window of the real house.

Outside the real house -- we see it is dilapidated, and
undeniably, the perfect haunted house.

FADE OUT."

Trapped by pretty eyes and letters for all time

Her sparkling eyes make me weak at my words, they tremble

The winter coldens me for I have yet to sleep
And never will I give up trying cause you're everything to me

It will kill you in the sunshine or happily in the dark
Where kindness is a card game or a bent-up cigarette
In the trenches, in the hard rain, with a bullet and a bet

He says, ""help me out""
Hell is coming
Could you do it now?
Hell is here

See the sterile soil
Poisoned sky
Yellow water

Bringing new tears

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

[Chorus]
And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

[Verse 2]
All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

[Chorus]
But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

The cup is not half empty as pessimists say
As far as he sees nothing's left in the cup
A whole cup full of nothing for him to indulge
Since the voice of ambition has long since been shut up

[Chorus 1]
A singer, a writer, he's not dreaming now of going nowhere
He gave heed to nothing, and all that he was is just a tragedy

[Verse 2]
So he voyages in circles and succeeds getting nowhere
And submits to the substance, that first got him there
There, there, there

[Chorus 2]
In violent frustration he cries out to God or just no one
Is there a point to this madness, and all that he was is just a tragedy

[Bridge]
He feels alone
His heart in his hand, he's alone
He feels alone
I feel…

[Verse 3]
Then on that last day he breaks
And he stood tall, and he yelled, and he yelled
(Why world, why world, hate you, hate you, bye world)

In violent frustration he cries out to God or just no one
Is there a point to this madness, and all that he was is just a tragedy"

Hiding at the bottom of your

Through the center of the storm

They packed their bags only moments too late
With the pounding waves crashing up against the weakened water gates

Were holding out for posterity and self-defense

The rich will take the poor

And we can hang our heads down
As we skip the goodbyes
And you can tell the world what you want them to hear
I've got nothing left to lose, my dear
So, I'm up for the little white lies
But you and I know the reason why
I'm gone, and you're still there
I'm gone, and you're still there
I'm gone, and you're still there

I'll buy a magazine searching for your face
From coast to coast, or whatever I find my place
I'll track you on the radio, and
I'll sign your list in a different name
But as close as I come to you
It's not the same

So, I will head out alone and hope for the best
We can pat ourselves on the back
As say that we tried
And if one of us makes it big
We can spill our regrets
And talk about how the love never dies
But you and I know the reason why
I'm gone, and you're still there
I'm gone, and you're still there
I'm gone, and you're still there

So, steal the show, and do your best
To cover the tracks that I have left
I wish you well and hope you find
Whatever you're looking for
The way I might've changed my mind
But you only showed my the door

So, I will head out alone and hope for the best
We can pat ourselves on the back
And say that we tried
And if one of us makes it big
We can spill our regrets
And talk about how the love never dies
But you and I, you and I know the reason why"

When the rain won't stop
When you feel unloved
When you try so hard
And it all falls apart
When a promise breaks
When the colors fade
When the world looks grey
And you can't find your way

[Chorus]
I got you ooh
I got you ooh
I got you ooh
Through the darkness
And the heartless
When the rain won't stop
When you feel unloved
When it all falls through
I got you
I will hold your high
I'll be by your side
When it all falls through
I got you

[Verse 2]
When you lose your faith
When you're out of place
When the water's deep
And it's hard to breathe
When the bottles close
When you've lost control
Hope against all hope
So far from home

[Chorus]
I got you ooh
I got you ooh
I got you ooh
Through the darkness
And the heartless
When the rain won't stop
When you feel unloved
When it all falls through
I got you
I will hold your high
I'll be by your side
When it all falls through
I got you

When the rain won't stop
When it all falls through
I got you"

[Verse 1]
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

[Chorus 1]
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

[Verse 2]
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

[Chorus 2]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""

And empty-handed after two long years

There's things I remember and things I forget
I miss you, I guess that I should
Three thousand five hundred miles away
But what would you change if you could?

I need a phone call, maybe I should buy a new car
I can always hear a freight train, baby, if I listen real hard
And I wish, I wish it was a small world
Because I'm lonely for the big towns

No turning back

How I know your face, all the ways you move, you come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone to make me come alive

[Bridge]
And when we're making love
I'd give up everything up for your touch

[Chorus]
How I know your face, all the ways you move
You come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone to make me come alive

When you go to work all the day I wait
For you to come home, recount our time, in our little place
Our little place, our little place
Our little place, our little place, our little place"

Two sides twist and then collide
You're calling off the guards (Am I coming?)
I'm coming through (Am I coming?)
Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission
You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in
(Sometimes, it just feels better to give in)

[Chorus]
And it's all too familiar
And it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny
(You I can't deny)

[Verse 2]
Dull heat rises from the sheets
I'm both a patient boy
Well, and a jealous man (Am I coming?)
My double standardized suspicion
Is remedied, oh, my blue heaven
Sometimes, it just feels better to give in
(Sometimes, it just feels better to give in)

[Chorus]
And it's all too familiar
And it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny
(You I can't deny)

[Bridge]
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
""You're safe, child, you are safe
(You're safe, child, you are safe)
You're safe, child, you are safe""
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
""You're safe, child, you are safe

Safe (Safe), safe (Safe)
You are safe""
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
""You're safe, child, you are safe"" (Am I coming?)
""You're safe, child, you are safe"" (Am I-)
Coming through?

[Outro]
Is this all too familiar?
Does it happen all the time?
I'm just asking you to hear me
Could you please, just once, just hear me?
More than anything you wanted to be right
Still it's you, you, it's you I can't deny

It's you I can't deny"

There's a story
I would like to tell
My problem is
It's one you know too well
It's one you know too well

Ms. Suzy Lee
The one I'm speaking of
The question is
Is she the one I love?
Is she the one I love? (alright)

Is she the one I love?
Is she the one I love?

[Verse 2]
She sent me flowers
With her tears burned inside
And you know what I'd do
I would run and hide
I would run and hide

And the paper
On it was my name
With the question
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same? (alright)

To end this tale
The one I'm speaking of
I wish I had an answer but I just don't know
Is this really love?
Is this really love?

Is this really love?
Is this really love?"

What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline
Of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain

[Verse 2]
I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on

[Verse 3]
And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

[Verse 4]
And when I awoke
And felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair
With my grateful tears
Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, I love you"

Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late

It's too late

Take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat

Let's get together and talk about the modern age
All of our friends were gathered there
With their pets, just talking shit
About how we're all so upset
About the disappearing ground
As we watch it melt...

[Chorus]
It's all of the good that won't come out of us
And how eventually, our hands will just turn to dust
If we keep shaking them
Standing here on this frozen lake

[Verse 2]
I do this thing where I think I'm real sick
But I won't go to the doctor to find out about it
'Cause they make you stay real still in a real small space
As they chart up your insides and put them on display
They'd see all of it, all of me, all of it

[Chorus]
All of the good that won't come out of me
And all the stupid lies I hide behind
It's such a big mistake
Lying here in your warm embrace

[Bridge]
Oh, you're almost home
I've been waiting for you to come in
Dancing around in your old suits
Going crazy in your room again
I think I'll go out and embarrass myself
By getting drunk and falling down in the street
You say I choose sadness
That it never once has chosen me
Maybe you're right...

[Verse 3]
Let's talk about all our friends who lost the war
And all of the novels that had yet to be written about them

[Chorus]
It's all of the good that won't come out of them
And all the stupid lies they hide behind
It's such a big mistake
Standing here on this frozen lake

It's all of the good that won't come out of me
And how eventually, my mouth will just turn to dust
If I don't tell you quick
Standing here on this frozen lake"

Sometimes I want to quit this all and become an accountant now
But I'm no good at math and besides, the dollar is down
Plant palm trees on Lake Michigan before it gets cold
I gotta feel the wind chill again before I get old

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to scream ""I love you"" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me

[Chorus]
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital, I know we're gonna leave this town
And get new passports and get, get, get, get, get out now

[Verse 2]
All the yes-men said ""no comment,"" my mouth got going
The wrong way and all the calls started snowing
The time my dad caught me a horse shoe crab and I asked him if
Throwing it back into the sea would bring our luck back

I want to scream ""I love you"" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me

Like a stove, I'll turn my love down

In the business of souls

But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me, whoa
I want to scream ""I love you"" from the top of my lungs

You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song

In the smile that you leave me with
When you walk away and say goodbye
Well, I don't expect
The world to move underneath me
But for God's sake, could you try?
I know that you're true to me
You're always there, you say you care
I know that you wanna be mine

Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need?
I want your heart to bleed
And that's all I'm asking for
Oh, where is your heart?

I don't understand
Your love is so cold
It's always me that's reaching out for your hand
And I've always dreamed
That love would be effortless
Like a petal falling to the ground
A dreamer following his dream

Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you

Maybe it's love but it's like you said... love is like a role that we play
But I believe in you so much I could die for the words that you say
But I believe in you so much I could die from the words that you say

But you're chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing is getting away from you again while you're chasing ghosts

I guess it's luck, but it's the same hard luck you've been trying to tame
Maybe it's love but it's like you said... love is like a role that we play

But they weren't meant for this
No, they weren't meant for this
Just bend the pieces 'til they fit, like they were made for it

You're crying, ""Let's make a toast!""

She says she's leaving on a Sunday
Oh, that leaves me one more night
Can I take you home?
I know it's wrong, but I know your type

She says she's leaving on a Sunday
I don't care, I need to know where to turn
I tried it once, it never caught on
I was the only one who got burned

I've read every word you've said
From a poster of a cat
Four books look across your sofa
I thought your coffee table was more clever than that
It gets worse once we get to her room
She stops and she sings, ""Do do do do do do do do""
I claim ""New Religion"" is my song
She doesn't get it
It's all before she was born

And you lock your door
Like I've been here before
I feel like I've seen a ghost

Suddenly between sheets and eyelids
I am reminded why I don't do this
I fall in love far too quickly
I never want her to forget me
When you're gone
Will you call, will you write?

She says she's leaving on a Sunday
I don't care, I need to know where to turn

1866,867,Future Foe Scenarios,Silversun Pickups,320,Carnavas,2007-05-21,"The things we laid do not amount to much
Made of abandoned wood, loose stones, and such

This revolution, baby
Proves who you work for lately

Release the castaways who run amok
From self-appointed winds which blow and such
When present tense gets strangled in the mire
Made of our cozy decomposing wires

Who do you work for, baby?
And does it work for you lately?

But when the night is over and the walls start burning
When fire starts to matter and the clock's still churning
Clichés and other chatter keeps our minds from learning
Our minds keep learning

It's alright, it's alright

The things we laid do not amount to much
Made up of thought balloons and cotton swabs
When present tense gets strangled in the woes
Made of our future foe scenarios

This revolution, baby
Proves who you work for maybe
Who do you work for, baby?
And does it work for you lately

But when the night is over and the walls start linking
When fire starts to matter and the clock's still sinking
Clichés and other chatter keeps our minds from thinking
Our minds keep shrinking

It's alright, it's alright
It's alright. It's alright

That's when it turned on me
A motorcade of 'meant to be's’
Parades of beauty queens
Where soft entwines make kindling
These many detailed things
Like broken nails and plastic rings
Will win by keeping me
From speaking to my new darling

And there's no way to know
Our future foe scenarios
That's when it turned on me
Where bobby pins held angel wings"
1867,868,Own It,Drake,251,Nothing Was the Same,2013-09-24,"[Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib & PARTYNEXTDOOR]

[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it
It's yours
It's yours

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and

[Verse 2: Drake]
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in, ha!
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a ""sorry""
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, it's yours, it's yours, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, baby, own it, it's yours, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit"
1868,869,Be Still,The Killers,273,Battle Born,2012-09-17,"[Verse 1]
Be still
Go on to bed
Nobody knows what lies ahead
Life is short to say the least
We're in the belly of the beast
Be still, wild and young
Long may your innocence reign
Like shells on a shore
May your limits be unknown
May your efforts be your own
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore

[Chorus]
Don't break character
You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Rise up like the sun
Labor till the work is done

[Verse 2]
Be still
One day you'll lead
Fearlessness on your sleeve
When you come back, tell me what did you see
Was there something out there for me
Be still
Close your eyes
Soon enough, you'll be on your own, steady and straight
And if they drag you through the mud
It doesn't change what's in your blood
Over rock, over chain
When they knock you down

[Chorus]
Don't break character
You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Rise up like the sun
Labor till the work is done

[Bridge]
Over rock and chain
Over sunset plane
Over trap and snare
When you're in too deep
In your wildest dreams
In your made up schemes
When they knock you down
When they knock you down

[Chorus]
Don't break character
You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Rise up like the sun
Labor till the work is done"
1869,870,Just The Way You Are,Barry White,289,The Collection,1978-09-22,"(Speaking)
I never take anything for granted
Only a fool maybe takes things for granted
Just because it's here today
It can be gone tomorrow
And that's one thing that you
Never in your life ever have to worry about me
If I'll ever change towards you because
Baby I love you
Yeah I love you
Just the way... You are...

Don't go changing, trying to please me
You never let me down before
I don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
I don't want to work that hard
I just want some someone to talk to
I want you just the way you are

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you

I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from my heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are"
1870,871,Anytime,Brian McKnight,0,Anytime,1997-09-23,"[Verse 1]
I can't remember why we fell apart
From something that was so meant to be, yeah
Forever was the promise in our hearts
Now more and more I wonder where you are

[Chorus]
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
I miss you

[Verse 2]
Still have your picture in a frame
Hear your footsteps down the hall
I swear I hear your voice, driving me insane
How I wish that you would call to say

[Chorus]
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
I miss you

[Verse 3]
I miss you, I miss you
No more loneliness and heartache
No more crying myself to sleep
Don't want no more wondering about tomorrow
Won't you come back to me, come back to me, oh

[Chorus]
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
I miss you

[Outro]
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you"

We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all

[Verse 1]
I can pretend that I'm not lonely
But I'll be constantly fooling myself
I can pretend that it don't matter
But I'll be sitting here lying to myself
Some say love ain't worth the buck
But I'll give every dime I have left
To have what I've only been dreaming about

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wants something, gotta want something
What are you living for?
Everybody needs something, fighting for something
I know what you're fighting for, 'cause we all...

[Chorus]
We all want someone there to hold
We just want somebody
We all wanna be somebody's one and only
We all wanna be warm when it’s cold
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I cut a star down with my knife

And right now
I still see the way the moon
Plays this tune
Though our nights died

My hands shake, my knees quake
It's every day, the same way
Cause then came you, then there's you
I keep your picture in my worn through shoes
Then there's you then came you
When I'm lost I look at my picture of you

And somehow
I'll make tonight our own
I'll show you every way I've grown
Since I met you

And right now
I'll be the boy in your next song
I'll learn the parts and play along
If you let me

My hands shake, my knees quake
It's every day, the same way
Cause then came you, then there's you
I keep your picture in my worn through shoes
Then there's you then came you
When I'm lost I look at my picture of you

If you let me, I'll show the world to you
Yes if you let me, I'll know just what to do

Cause then came you, then there's you
I keep your picture in my worn through shoes

When I'm lost in your eyes
I see a way for me"

However inconsiderate it seems
Do you still consider me
Consider me the boy you laughed with
Or you learned to live without?
I suck
I know I'm late
I know you waited
You wouldn't get me on the phone
And you couldn't make me not alone

The phone bill's stacked up by my bedside
With your picture, you're looking surprised
You're what makes
New England so great
My Island nights are all spent dying
Wait for summer
To become wrought with lips
(My wishful thinking)

You wouldn't get me on the phone
And you couldn't make me not alone
Yeah, you wouldn't get me
You wouldn't get me
You wouldn't get me on the phone

I'm a national phenomenon
Nothing's absolutely definite
Till it's absolutely, definitely gone

I never thought this day would end

I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me
So let my hands stray
Past the boundaries of your back
And get you breathing
And get this started

Sunrise, sunset
Swiftly go the days
Sunrise, sunset
You wake up, then you undress
It always is the same
The sunrise and the sunsets
You are lying while you confess, keep trying to explain
The sunrise and the sunsets
You realize then you forget what you've been trying to retain
But everybody knows that it is all about the things
That get stuck inside of your head
Like the songs your roommate sings
Or a vision of her body as she stretches out on your bed
She raised her hands in the air, asked you
When was the last time you looked in the mirror?
Cause you've changed
Yeah, you've changed


Sunrises, sunsets
You're hopeful then you regret
The circle never breaks
With a sunrise and a sunset there's a change of heart or address
Is there nothing that remains?
For a sunrise or a sunset
You're manic or you're depressed
Will you ever feel ok?
For a sunrise or a sunset, your lover is an actress
Did you really think she'd stay?
For a sunrise or a sunset
You're either coming or you just left but you're always on the way
Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet
They are really just the same
To the sunrise and the sunset
The master and his servant have exactly the same fate
It's a sunrise and a sunset
From a cradle to a casket
There is no way to escape
The sunrise and the sunset
Hold your sadness like a puppet, keep putting on the play
But everything you do is leading to the point
Where you just won't know what to do
And at that moment you may laugh
But there is someone there who will be laughing louder than you
So it's true, the trick is complete
Become everything you said you never would be
You're a fool! You're a fool!

The prophets and their pawns have had another success
I'm wondering why we bother at all

And I think of you on cold winter mornings
Darling they remind me of when we were at school
Nothing really mattered when you called out my name
In fact Nothing really mattered at all

And I think about how long it will take them to blow us away
But I won't get me down
I'm just thankful to facing the day
Cause days don't get you far when you're gone

It's 5 o' clock on a Friday morning
One hundred telephones sit and ring
One of them's from someone who knew you
And I still think of you on cold winter mornings

Darling they'll still remind me of when we were at school
When they could never have persuaded me that lives like yours were in the hands of these erroneous fools
And to those of you who live your lives from one day to the next
Well, let them take you to next
Can't you live and be thankful you're here?
See it could be you tomorrow, next year"

All wrapped in bones of setting sun
All dust and stone and moribund
I paid twenty-five cents to light
A little white candle
For a New Year's Day
I sat and watched it burn away
Then turned and weaved
Through slow decay
We were both a little hungry
So we went to get hot dog

Down to Hyde Street Pier
The light was slight and disappeared
The air it stunk of fish and beer
We heard a Superman trumpet
Play the national anthem

And the world may be long for you
But'll never belong to you
But on a motorbike
When all the city lights
Blind your eyes tonight
Are you feeling better now?

Some way to greet the year:
Your eyes all bright and
Brim with tears
The pilgrims, pills, and tourists here
Will sink fifty-three bucks to buy
A brand new halo

Sweet on a green-eyed girl
All fiery Irish clip and curl
All brine and piss and vinegar
I paid twenty-five cents to light
A little white candle

And the world may be long for you
But'll never belong to you
But on a motorbike
When all the city lights
Blind your eyes tonight
Are you feeling better now?"

Lose track of how to get going again

Feel myself turning round
Is this taken?

When I feel like this
When I get so sick of myself
Where are you going then
Without me and not knowing then
That we're slowing down
You've got to turn right around
And tell me that I'm taken then
Tell me if I'm yours

You can't be held accountable
If you go, you go
If you go, you go

I feel like I have only missed
The feeling that I'm here again
The feeling that I'm clear again
I'm not taken

Feel myself letting go

Though a constant game of falling short

If you know, you know

When I'm just so sick of feeling less than perfect
Isn't right for me
I never fight to see
If coming clean would get to me
I feel myself holding back
I feel the pressure, it's finally back
I'm taken

When you felt like this
When you saw it all come crashing down
Subtle but not underground
I was there, I saw the signs
I saw unfair and so
I write to you through other means
I let myself finally feel taken
Like I was yours

I am taken, I am yours

The spinning never stops
I just want someone to walk in front
And I'll follow the leader

Started carrying her books and doing lots of drugs. I almost forgot who I was
But came to my senses
Now I'm tryin' to be assertive
I'm making plans
Wanna rise to the occasion, yeah
Meet all of their demands
But all I do is just lay in bed
And hide under the covers
I know I should be brave
But I'm just too afraid of all this change
And it's too hard to focus through all this doubt
I keep making these ""To Do"" lists but nothing gets crossed out
Working on the record seems pointless now
When the world ends, who's gonna hear it?
But Im tryin' and take some comfort in written words
Yeah Tim I heard your album and it's better than good
When you get off tour I think we should hang and black out together
Because I've been feeling sentimental for days gone by...
All those summers singing, drinking, laughing, wasting out time
Remember all those songs and the way we smiled
In those basements made of music
But now I've got to crawl, to get anywhere at all. I'm not as strong as I thought
So when I'm lost in a crowd
I hope that you'll pick me out
Oh, how I long to be found
The grass grew high. I laid down
Now I wait for a hand to lift me up, help me stand
I have been laying so low
Don't want to lay here no more
Don't want to lay here no more
Don't want to lay here no more
Don't want to lay here no more

And it is predetermined, can't change your destiny

It is older than Rome and all of this sorrow
See the new Pyramids down in old Manhattan
From the roof of a friend's, I watched an empire ending
Heard it loud and long, the river's song
Time marching on, to a mad man's drum

Don't forget what you've learned
All you give is returned
And if life seems absurd
What you need is some laughter
And a season to sleep
And a place to get clean
Maybe Los Angeles
Somewhere no one's expecting

On a detox walk
Through a Glendale Park
Over sidewalk chalk
Some wrote in red, ""start over""

So I muffle my scream
On an Oxnard beach
Full of fevered dreams that scare you sober
Into saltless dinners

Take the fruit from the tree, break the skin with your teeth
Is it bitter or sweet all depends on your timing
Like a meeting of chance
With a train station glance
Many lifetimes have passed in a instant reminded
Of a millstone house in a seaside town
When your heart gave out in a mission bed

So your wife gave birth to a funeral dirge
As you woke up purged as a wailing infant
In Krung Thep, Thailand

Hear the chimes, did you know that the wind when it blows
It is older than Rome and our joy and our sorrow"

Faces long and grim
Souls are feeling heavy
And faith is growing thin
Fears are getting stronger
You can feel them on the rise
Hopelessness got some by the throat you can see it in their eyes

I said how come
How come

Everybody on a shoestring
Everybody in a hole
Everybody on an old jet plane crossing their fingers and toes
Government man spin his politics till they got you pinned
Everybody trying to reach out to each other
But they don't know where to begin
I said how come
I can't tell
The free world
From living hell
I said how come
How come
All I see
Is a child of god
In misery
I said how come

The pistol now as prophet
The bullet some kind of lord and king
But pain is the only promise that this so called savior is gonna bring
Love can be a liar
And justice can be a thief
And freedom can be an empty cup from which everybody want to drink

I said how come
I can't tell
The free world
From living hell
I said how come
How come
All i see
Is a child of god
In misery
I said how come

And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches

Can't breathe when I'm around her

She scratched the surface
She'll never notice

To really love a woman
To understand her - You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody

Really, really ever loved a woman?

You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman

When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one

Oh - You got to give her some faith - Hold her tight
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you

You know you really love a woman

When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted

[Verse 1]
If I could write, I'd tell you how much I've missed these nights
Where we'd dig around the bones
And try to find peace and patches for the holes
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
The corner boys told her how I was dyin' to meet her
Like a prayer I said on a dead man's knee
You drove up like a parade

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart straight in my arms
Fell straight in my arms

[Verse 2]
And I miss it sometimes
Shakin' like a leaf on the corner of Vine
But I heard it's alright
The radio spoke to a good friend of mine
And I can feel it comin' up as the night's gettin' warm
I saw your summer dress hangin' on the back of the lawn
Like a dream I remember from an easier time
With the top rolled down on a Saturday night

[Chorus]
You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart right in my arms
Right in my arms

And I always dreamed of classic cars and movie screens
And tryin' to find some way to be redeemed
Bring a dollar with you, baby
In the cold, cold ground

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

I was dressed all in black with dark glasses and attitude
Such a pose I could simply not hold

And your studies of fringe New York streets
I was reading the pavement in every word you would speak
To a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on

Buying drinks for the poets upstate
The southern corruption tows you down the interstate
And they all said that you were the king
Of a gloomy disruption that surfaced when you would sing
And this town cannot begin to compete
So I'm packing my Bullets and Silvertones and heading east
To a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on
On, on, on, it's...

This year would bridge '66 again

And if the tempo was lousy, it was lost on all but you
'Cause your studies of fringe New York streets:
I was reading the pavement in every word you would speak
To a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on
On, on, on, it's on

If I could've had my way
This year would bridge '66 again
If I could've had my way

This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say bye (No, no, no)
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye

[Verse 1]
As a child, there were them times
I didn't get it, but you kept me in line
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings, and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things
Separation brings
You never let me know it
You never let it show because
You loved me and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today face to face

[Chorus]
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
""I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by""
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

[Verse 2]
And you never got the chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

[Chorus]
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
""I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by""
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (The hardest thing to say, bye bye)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

En el ardor de una noche romántica
Mis aullidos son el llamado
Yo quiero un lobo domesticado

Por fin he encontrado un remedio infalible
Que borre del todo la culpa
No pienso quedarme a tu lado mirando la tele
Y oyendo disculpas
La vida me ha dado un hambre voraz
Y tú apenas me das caramelos (Ah)
Me voy con mis piernas y mi juventud por ahí
Aunque te maten los celos

Llevo el número de los bomberos
Ni tipos muy lindos ni divos ni niños ricos yo sé lo que quiero (Ay)

En los brazos de algún caballero

The way you swing your hips in jeans
I want to wear my face like you

And tickle you until you scream

But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Bridge]
I know
I know
I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone, no

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it"

I got one two three four
Five, six, sick, sick
Running 'round the neighborhood
Pejorative, ""Jinx,"" he said
The groom is down on me, 'cause he ate the rice
It was well-intentioned but bad advice
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah

Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah
Let it break through, oh, let it break through

And let in some sky
It's almost half past two and you
You can tell by the light, oh yeah
Open your window
And let in the atmosphere

Let it break through, oh, let it break through

[Verse 1]
There's fifty-two ways to murder anyone
One and two are the same and they both work as well
I'm coming clean for Amy
Julie doesn't scream as well and the cops won't listen all night
And so maybe I'll be over
Just as soon as I fill them all in

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can remember when I saw her last
We were runnin' all around and havin' a blast, havin' a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in is so lonely without you
I know when you're home, I was thinkin' about you
There was somethin' I forgot to say, I was cryin' on Saturday night

[Chorus]
I was out cruisin' without you
They were playin' our song
Cryin' on Saturday night

[Verse 2]
As the moon becomes the night time
You go viciously, quietly, away
I'm sitting in the bedroom
Where we used to sit and smoke cigarettes
Now I'm watchin', watchin' you die
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I can remember when I saw her last
We were runnin' all around and havin' a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in is so lonely without you

Love is tragic, love is bold
You will always do what you are told
Love is hard, love is strong
You will never say that you were wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know when I got bitter
But love is surely better when it's gone

[Chorus]
'Cause you wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live
You wanted more
More than I could bear
More than I could offer
For a love that isn't there

[Verse 2]
Love is color, love is loud
Love is never saying you're too proud
Love is trusting, love is honest
Love is not a hand to hold you down

I got to pick me up when I am down
I got to get my feet back on the ground
I got to pick me up when I am down

You wanted more
More than I could love
More than I could offer
The harder you would shove
You wanted more

I know I said I love you, but I'm thinking I was wrong
I'm the first to admit that I'm still pretty young
And I never meant to hurt you when I wrote you ten love songs

That guy that I could never get
His girlfriend was pretty fit
And everyone who knew her loved her so

And I made you leave her for me
And now I'm feeling pretty mean
But my mind has fucked me over more times than any man could ever know

[Pre-Chorus]

Maybe I should give up giving
Give up trying to be thin
Give up and turn into my mother
God knows I love her

[Chorus]

And I'm sorry to whichever man
Should meet my sorry state
Watch my sturdy, lonesome gait
And beware

I will never love a man
Cause love and pain go hand in hand
And I can't do it again

[Verse 2]

So we stayed up late one night
To try and get our problems right
But I couldn't get into his head just what was going through my mind

Thinking he knew where I was going
He put Ryan Adams on
I think he thinks it makes me weaker, but it only ever makes me strong

I've got this friend who sounds just like him
And he's the man I leave you for
The man that I just adore like you

The same man, he turns to me
He said ""I've got to tell you how I feel
If God could make the perfect girl, for me it would be you""

And my God told me not to tell
About how much do you love your fella
I don't know more everyday
Not in this new romantic way

[Pre-Chorus]

I'll always be your first love
You'll always be my first love

[Chorus]

But I'm sorry to whichever man
Should meet my sorry state
Watch my sturdy, lonesome gait
And beware

I will never love a man
Cause love and pain go hand in hand
And I can't do it again

I will never love a man
Cause I could never hurt a man
Not in this new romantic way"

Tell me what do you see, when you're looking at me
On a mission to be, what I'm destined to be
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothing but love
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above
All the above (x7)

[Verse One: Maino]
Listen! Really what do you see, when you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams
I've done been through the bottom, I've done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I got nothing but love, now that I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money make all of us change
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me, and I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me, but these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets, till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally done made it
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse Two: Maino]
It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you living my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seeing me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't, I envision Obama
I envision in diamonds, I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm making a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness


[Hook: T-Pain]

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Now if I'm out on the spot
Or if I'm out on the block
I hustle hard cause it's all the same (They know, they know)
If you know that grind don't stop
Because I rose to the top
And everybody knows my name (Maino, Maino)
Hey! I'm still grinding, still hustling
No more pain, no more suffering
My ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Keep on dancing and shining for love

1999,1000,So Glad to See You,Hot Chip,245,The Warning,,"So glad to see that you came
Like all birds together we will squawk and we squeak
The joy comes from all our beaks
And ringing bells is our fun
Now our ass is moving as one

If we are forgetting all the rules that we learnt
As all the rule books are burnt
And just as A follows B
Our chorus must always be

So glad to see that you came
We had best times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go home

I have but one true friend
She sings to me in my solitude
And I know her name
I tried to know her, in all her changes
And I don't know her place
And I don't see her face

When we come together then we forget ourselves
And just as night follows day
The beginning must become the end
And so we will start again
When we come together then we meet other souls
And then we make our goodbye
And we lay our bones to rest
As birds we dream of the sky

Please let me go
Please help me go

So glad to see that you came
We had nice times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go home
We had best times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go home

I have but one true friend
She sings to me in my solitude
And I know her name
I tried to know her, in all her changes
And I don't know her place
And I don't see her face

When we come together then we forget ourselves
And just as night follows day
The beginning must become the end
And so we will start again
When we come together then we meet other souls
And then we make our goodbye
And we lay our bones to rest
As birds we dream of the sky

Please let me go
Please help me go

So glad to see that you came
We had nice times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go home"
