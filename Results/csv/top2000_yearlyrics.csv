Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you should have somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Verse 2]
Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

[Pre-Chorus]
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how

[Chorus]
Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall

Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
By now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do

And all the lights that light the way are blinding

Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart
Questions of science, science and progress
Do not speak as loud as my heart
Tell me you love me, come back and haunt me
Oh, and I rush to the start
Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?

Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you

And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go

We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone

If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?

How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough

Forget what we're told

Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own

All that I ever was
Is here in your perfect eyes
They're all I can see

Confused about how as well
Just know that these things
Will never change for us at all

If I just lay here
Would you lie with me

And all I can breathe is your life

Well, you done done me, and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
And now I'm trying to get back
Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some

But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours
Hmm (Hey, hey)

Well, open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free
And look into your heart, and you'll find love, love, love, love

We're just one big family
And it's our God-forsaken right to be loved, love, love, love, loved

So I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm sure

There's no need to complicate
Our time is short

Scooch on over closer, dear
And I will nibble your ear
A-soo da ba ba ba ba bum
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoa, oh oh oh oh whoa whoa whoa
Uh-huh, hmm

[Verse 3]
I've been spending way too long checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
I guess what I've been saying is there ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities and just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue

But I won't hesitate no more
No more it cannot wait, I'm yours

Well, open up your mind and see like me (I won't hesitate)
Open up your plans and, damn, you're free (No more, no more)
And look into your heart, and you'll find that (It cannot wait)
The sky is yours (I'm sure there's no)
So please don't, please don't, please don't (No need, oh, now now)
There's no need to complicate (For the reggae, our time)
'Cause our time is short (Is short, this)
This oh, this oh, this is our fate (Is our fate)
I'm yours, ha!

7,8,I Will Follow You Into The Dark,Death Cab for Cutie,Plans,6/26/2006,"[Verse 1]
Love of mine, someday you will die
But I'll be close behind; I'll follow you into the dark
No blinding light or tunnels to gates of white
Just our hands clasped so tight, waiting for the hint of a spark

[Chorus]
If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""No""s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Verse 2]
In Catholic school, as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised by a lady in black
And I held my tongue as she told me, ""Son
Fear is the heart of love,"" so I never went back

If Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
Illuminate the ""No""s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

[Bridge]
You and me have seen everything to see
From Bangkok to Calgary and the soles of your shoes
Are all worn down; the time for sleep is now
It's nothing to cry about 'cause we'll hold each other soon
In the blackest of rooms

[Chorus]
And if Heaven and Hell decide that they both are satisfied
And illuminate the ""No""s on their Vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you when your soul embarks
Then I'll follow you into the dark

Then I'll follow you into the dark"
8,9,How to Save a Life,The Fray,How to Save a Life,9/13/2005,"[Verse 1]
Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say ""sit down; it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

How to save a life
How to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

9,10,Love Will Tear Us Apart,Joy Division,Die Kalten Winde Des Winters,6/1/1980,"[Verse 1]
When routine bites hard and ambitions are low
And resentment rides high, but emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways, taking different roads

[Chorus]
Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

[Verse 2]
Why is the bedroom so cold? You've turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed? Our respect runs so dry
Yet there's still this appeal that we've kept through our lives

But love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again

You cry out in your sleep, all my failings exposed
And there's a taste in my mouth as desperation takes hold
Just that something so good, just can't function no more

Then love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Then love, love will tear it apart again
Love, love will tear it apart again"

And wound up at your door
I've had you so many times
But somehow, I want more

Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

You come any time you want, yeah

11,12,Such Great Heights,The Postal Service,Give Up,1/1/2003,"[Verse 1]
I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

[Verse 2]
And true, it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

[Chorus]
They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

[Verse 3]
I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat
It sounded thin upon listening

And that frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

[Chorus]
They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

Pour a little salt, we were never here

Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my

Come on, skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split

And at the end of all your lines

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns

For girls in the 80s
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears

She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing

The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered goodbye as she got on a plane
Never to return again

And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore

Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied
Keep playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same

Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture
And niggas'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister
Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room and ask me to initial
She call me the referee 'cause I be so official
My shirt ain't got no stripes, but I can make your pussy whistle
Like the Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love, you the one I lean on
Feelin' for a fix, then you should really get your fiend on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show, she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make your fuckin' bra strap pop
All up in your slot 'til a nigga hit the jackpot, I'm saying

I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 1: Mark Hoppus]
Hello there
The angel from my nightmare
The shadow in the background of the morgue
The unsuspecting victim of darkness in the valley
We can live like Jack and Sally if we want
Where you can always find me
And we'll have Halloween on Christmas
And in the night we'll wish this never ends
We'll wish this never ends

[Interlude: Mark Hoppus]
I miss you, I miss you
I miss you, I miss you

[Verse 2: Tom DeLonge]
Where are you?
And I'm so sorry
I cannot sleep, I cannot dream tonight
I need somebody and always
This sick, strange darkness
Comes creeping on so haunting every time
And as I stare I counted
The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides
Like indecision to call you
And hear your voice of treason
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

[Chorus: Tom DeLonge and Mark Hoppus]
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)
Don't waste your time on me you're already
The voice inside my head (I miss you, I miss you)

A hundred days have made me older
Since the last time that I saw your pretty face
A thousand lies have made me colder
And I don't think I can look at this the same
But all the miles that separate
Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face

[Chorus]
I'm here without you, baby
But you're still on my lonely mind
I think about you, baby
And I dream about you all the time
I'm here without you, baby

And tonight, it's only you and me, yeah

Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?

Spinning on that dizzy edge
Kissed her face and kissed her head
Dreamed of all the different ways I had to make her glow

""Why won't you ever know that I'm in love with you?
That I'm in love with you?""

Dancing in the deepest oceans
Twisting in the water

I must have been asleep for days
And moving lips to breathe her name
I opened up my eyes
And found myself alone, alone
Alone above a raging sea
That stole the only girl I loved
And drowned her deep inside of me

I'm right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice, it's my disguise
I'm by your side

That by the time we get through
The world will never ever be the same

To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough

The start of simple touch
One night to push and scream

Ten days of perfect hues
The colors red and blue

To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

There is no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
Our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
With sepia-toned loving

[Verse 2]
Love is the answer
At least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look up at stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too

Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

They look so...
So pretty when I sleep
And I wa...
And when I wake up
You look so pretty
Sleeping next to me
But there is
Not enough time
And there is no...
No song I could sing
And there is no
Combination of words I could say
But I will still
Tell you one thing
We're better together"

Well it goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall and the major lift
The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
And she tied you to her kitchen chair
And she broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Well, baby, I've been here before
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor
You know, I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
And love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 4]
Well, there was a time when you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show that to me, do ya?
But remember when I moved in you
And the holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Instrumental]

[Verse 5]
Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

[Chorus]
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

[Verse 1]
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet

[Pre-Chorus]
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

[Verse 2]
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better

That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win

[Chorus]
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screaming out your name
Your name

I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When it fell, something died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
The last time

Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waiting for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from looking for you

Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried

Closed off from love, I didn't need the pain
Once or twice was enough and it was all in vain

But something happened for the very first time with you
My heart melted to the ground
Found something true
And everyone's looking round thinking I'm going crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
I keep bleeding
I keep, keep bleeding love
Keep bleeding
Keep, keep bleeding love
You cut me open

Trying hard not to hear, but they talk so loud
Their piercing sounds fill my ears, try to fill me with doubt
Yet I know that their goal is to keep me from falling
But nothing's greater than the risk
That comes with your embrace
And in this world of loneliness, I see your face
Yet everyone around me thinks that I'm going crazy
Maybe, maybe

But I don't care what they say, I'm in love with you
They try to pull me away, but they don't know the truth

There's nothing wrong with just a little little fun

Love is a losing game
One I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game

Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Love is a losing hand
Self professed, profound
'Til the chips were down
Know you're a gambling man
Love is a losing hand

Though I battle blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Love, it is a fate resigned
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
And now the final frame
Love is a losing game"

It's tearing me apart

Is that the way we stand?
Were you lying all the time?
Was it just a game to you?

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-nooo!""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

So keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Keeping your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown
Now keep your love lockdown—you lose

I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

Just to meet me in the morning?

I’m glad I didn’t die before I met you
But now, I don’t care; I could go anywhere with you
And I’d probably be happy”

Come away with me and we'll kiss
On a mountaintop
Come away with me

Falling on a tin roof
While I'm safe there in your arms

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain in
Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but boy, they pour when

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, ooh no, no, no
I've been thinkin' bout you, you know, know, know
I've been thinkin' bout you, do you think about me still?
Do ya, do ya?

Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh
Or do you not think so far ahead?
'Cause I been thinkin' bout forever, ooh

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it though, I'm lying down

What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

[Chorus]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Then why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Chorus]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself…

[Bridge: will.i.am]
Where is the love?

I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe, that the pictures are all I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you
Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you
Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go

[Verse 3]
Remembering you
Fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you
How you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything

If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart

Than to feel you deep in my heart

Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster

Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

So testosterone boys and harlequin girls, dance to this beat
So testosterone boys and harlequin girls, dance to this beat

103,104,Such Great Heights,Iron & Wine,Underdog Alma Mater,,"[Verse 1]
I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

[Verse 2]
And true, it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows and when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

[Chorus]
They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

[Verse 3]
I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine but the persistent beat it
Sounded thin upon listenin'

And that frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows with the windows down
And this is guiding you home

[Chorus]
They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay"

So, just say how to make it right
And I swear I'll do my best to comply

With these revisions and gaps in history
So let me help you remember
I've made charts and graphs that should finally make it clear
I've prepared a lecture on why I have to leave

You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue

And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while

Your body is a wonderland

Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it

You want love, we'll make it

She puts on her make-up and brushes her long blonde hair
And then she asks me, ""Do I look all right?""
And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight""

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me ""Do you feel all right?""
And I say, ""Yes, I feel wonderful tonight""

I feel wonderful because I see
The love light in your eyes
And the wonder of it all
Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

It's time to go home now and I've got an aching head
So I give her the car keys and she helps me to bed
And then I tell her, as I turn out the light

Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals
And love is blind but that I knew when
My heart was blinded by yours
I've kissed your lips and held your hand
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend
You have been the one
You have been the one for me
Goodbye my lover
Goodbye my friend

You can't break my spirit - it's my dreams you take
And as you move on, remember me
Remember us and all we used to be
I've seen you cry, I've seen you smile
I've watched you sleeping for a while
I'd be the father of your child
I'd spend a lifetime with you
I know your fears and you know mine
We've had our doubts but now we're fine
And I love you, I swear that's true
I cannot live without you

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie

Moments of happiness elude
Maybe I just misunderstood

Tasting the air you're breathing in
I hope I won't forget a thing
Promise to hold you close and pray
Watching the fantasies decay
Nothing will ever stay the same
And all of the love we threw away
And all of the hopes we've cherished fade
Making the same mistakes again
Making the same mistakes again

And span the length of the Isle of Manhattan
I'd bring it to where you are
Making a lake of the East River and Hudson

If I could open my mouth
Wide enough for a marching band to march out
They would make your name sing
And bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings

I wish we could open our eyes
To see in all directions at the same time
Oh what a beautiful view
If you were never aware of what was around you

And it is true what you said
That I live like a hermit in my own head
But when the sun shines again
I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in

[Refrain x4]
Sorrow drips into your heart through a pin hole
Just like a faucet that leaks and there is comfort in the sound
But while you debate
""Half empty or half full?""
It slowly rises, your love is gonna drown

His wiry legs are crossed
And he's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss

That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

They say it fades if you let it
Love was made to forget it
I carved your name across my eyelids
You pray for rain, I pray for blindness

[Chorus 1]
If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love has fallen from me
If you still want me, please forgive me
Because the spark is not within me

[Post-Chorus]
I snuffed it out before my mom walked
In my bedroom

[Verse 2]
The only thing that you keep changing
Is your name, my love keeps growing
Still the same, just like a cancer
And you won't give me a straight answer

[Chorus 2]
If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love has fallen from me
If you still want me, please forgive me
Because your hands are not upon me

[Post-Chorus]
I shrugged them off before my mom walked
In my bedroom

[Verse 3]
The pains of love, and they keep growing
In my heart there's flowers growing
On the grave of our old love
Since you gave me a straight answer

If you still want me, please forgive me
The crown of love is not upon me
If you still want me, please forgive me

'Cause the spark is not within me
It's not within me

[Hook]
To be alone with you

You gave your body to the lonely

120,121,If I Ever Feel Better,Phoenix,United,6/12/2000,"[Intro]
They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
It's like a bad day that never ends
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life that I can't control

[Verse 1]
They say love ain't nothing but a sore
I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named
There's a part of my world that's fading away
You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please, tell me please

[Chorus]
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

[Verse 2]
Hang on to the good days
I can lean on my friends
They help me going through hard times
But I'm feeding the enemy
I'm in league with the foe
Blame me for what's happening
I can't try, I can't try, I can't try, I can't try
No one knows the hard times I went through
If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over
I've tried and lost now I think that I pay the cost
Now I've watched all my castles fall
They were made of dust, after all
Someday all this mess will make me laugh
I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait

[Chorus]
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know

[Bridge]
It's like somebody took my place
I ain't even playing my own game
The rules have changed well I didn't know
There are things in my life I can't control
I feel the chaos around me
A thing I don't try to deny
I'd better learn to accept that
There's a part of my life that will go away
Dark is the night, cold is the ground
In the circular solitude of my heart
As one who strives a hill to climb
I am sure I'll come through I don't know how
They say an end can be a start
Feels like I've been buried yet I'm still alive
I'm losing my balance on the tight rope
Tell me please, tell me please, tell me please, tell me please

[Chorus]
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number
When it's all over I'll let you know
If I ever feel better
Remind me to spend some good time with you
You can give me your number

And spring blooms and you find a love that's true
But you don't know what now to do
Cause the chase is all you know and she stopped running months ago

And all you see is where else you could be when you're at home
And out on the street are so many possibilities to not be alone

The flames and smoke climbed out of every window
And disappeared with everything that you held dear
But you shed not a single tear
For the things that you didn't need
Cause you knew you were finally free

Cause all you see is where else you could be when you're at home

[Verse 1]
My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart

[Refrain]
Swimming pool, glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coins

[Chorus 1]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

[Verse 2]
My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone

[Refrain]
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont, slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him

[Pre-Chorus]
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you own me
Gimme them coins

[Chorus 1]
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth

[Chorus 2]
Yo, I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it

[Bridge]
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, ""Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man""

[Chorus 3]
And we're off to the races, places
Ready, set, the gate is down and now we're goin' in
To Las Vegas, chaos, Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin
Boy, you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever, not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

You are my one true love"

It's been seven hours and fifteen days
Since you took your love away
I go out every night and sleep all day
Since you took your love away
Since you've been gone I can do whatever I want
I can see whomever I choose
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant
But nothing... I said nothing can take away these blues

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

[Verse 2]
It's been so lonely without you here
Like a bird without a song
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling
Tell me, baby, where did I go wrong
I could put my arms around every boy I see
But they'd only remind me of you
I went to the doctor and guess what he told me, guess what he told me?
He said, ""Girl, you better try to have fun no matter what you do,"" but he's a fool

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing compares
Nothing compares to you

All the flowers that you planted, mama, in the back yard
All died when you went away
I know that living with you, baby, was sometimes hard
But I'm willing to give it another try

Nothing compares to you
Nothing compares
Nothing compares to you"

I wish you were here
I wish you were here

Well, I met you at the blood bank
We were looking at the bags
Wondering if any of the colors
Matched any of the names we knew on the tags
You said ""See, look, that's yours
Stacked on top with your brother's
See how they resemble one another's
Even in their plastic little covers?""

[Chorus]
And I said I know it well
That secret that you know
But don't know how to tell
It fucks with your honor
And it teases your head
But you know that it's good girl
Because it's running you with red

[Verse 2]
Then the snow started falling
We were stuck out in your car
You were rubbing both of my hands
Chewing on a candy bar
You said ""Ain't this just like the present
To be showing up like this?""
As a moon waned to crescent
We started to kiss

[Chorus]
And I said I know it well
That secret that we know
That we don't know how to tell
I'm in love with your honor
I'm in love with your cheeks
What's that noise up the stairs, babe?
Is that Christmas morning creaks?

Jealous, weeping
Or lost you? American mouth

Nursing my sore blunt tongue
Watching the warm poison rats
Curl through the wide fence cracks
Pissing on magazine photos

Thrown in the cold and clean

Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
Reachin' for the phone 'cause I can't fight it anymore

And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me, it happens all the time

Said I wouldn't call, but I've lost all control and I need you now

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

[Verse 2]
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how

[Pre-Chorus 2]
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud

There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all

[Verse 2: John Lennon with Paul McCartney]
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new

Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more

The Atlantic was born today, and I'll tell you how
The clouds above opened up and let it out
I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
When the water filled every hole
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean
Making islands where no island should go
Oh, no

Most people were overjoyed, they took to their boats
I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your door
Have been silenced forevermore
The distance is quite simply much too far for me to row
It seems farther than ever before
Oh, no

I was waiting for a cross-town train in the London underground

So I changed my plans; I rented a camera and a van
And then I called you (And then I called you)
""I need you to pretend that we are in love again""
And you agreed to

I want so badly to believe
That ""there is truth, that love is real""
And I want life in every word

I greased the lens and framed the shot
Using a friend as my stand-in (As my stand-in)
The script, it called for rain, but it was clear that day
So we faked it
The marker snapped and I yelled ""quiet on the set""
And then called ""action!"" (And then called ""action!"")
And I kissed you in a style Clark Gable would have admired
I thought it classic

I want so badly to believe
That ""there is truth, that love is real""
And I want life in every word

And all the things that I wished I had not said
Are played in loops 'till it's madness in my head

Is it too late to remind you how we were?
But not our last days of silence, screaming, blurred
Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walking out the door

You could be happy, I hope you are
You made me happier than I'd been by far
Somehow everything I own smells of you
And for the tiniest moment it's all not true

And I was the class clown that always kept you laughing
We were never meant to be, baby, we just happened
So please, don't mess up the trick
Hey Young World, I'm the new Slick Rick
They say I move too quick but we can't let this moment pass us
Let the hourglass pass right into ashes
Let the wind blow the ash right before my glasses
So I wrote this love letter right before my classes
How could a goddess ask someone that's only average?
For advice, OMG, you listen to that, bitch
Woe is me, baby, this is tragic
'Cause we had it, we was magic
I was flying, now I'm crashing
This is Bad, real bad, Michael Jackson
Now I'm mad, real mad, Joe Jackson
You should leave your boyfriend now, I'm gon' ask him

[Verse 4: Keri Hilson]
So you gotta take the good with the bad, happy and the sad
And let it bring a better future than I had in the past
Oh, 'cause I don't wanna make the same mistakes I did
I don't wanna fall back on my face again
(Whoa, whoa) Mmh
I'll admit it, I was scared to act to love's call
(Whoa, whoa)
And if it hits better, make it worth the fall, until it comes around, hey

[Hook: Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo, Both]
Sometimes love comes around (love comes around, love comes around) (Comes around, whoa)
And it knocks you down
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Get back up when it knocks you down)
Sometimes love comes around (When love comes around) (When love comes around)
And it knocks you down (Eh eh) (Oh oh)
Just get back up, when it knocks you down, knocks you down (Eh eh) (Oh oh, when it knows you down, knocks you down)

[Outro: Both, Keri Hilson, Ne-Yo]
Won't see it coming when it happens (Eh)
But when it happens (Uh huh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now
You see when love comes and knocks you down (Oh, no, when it knocks you down)
Won't see it coming when it happens (Oh oh)
But when it happens (Ooh)
You're gonna feel it, let me tell you now (Tell you now)
You see when love comes and knocks you down

Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?

Just to spend a little time alone with me
And I can say I've never bought you flowers

169,170,What Sarah Said,Death Cab for Cutie,Plans,8/30/2005,"And it came to me then that every plan
Is a tiny prayer to father time
As I stared at my shoes in the ICU
That reeked of piss and 409
And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself
That I'd already taken too much today
As each descending peak on the LCD
Took you a little farther away from me
Away from me

Amongst the vending machines and year-old​ magazines
In a place where we only say goodbye
It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend
On a faulty camera in our minds
And I knew that you were truth I would rather lose
Than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground
As the TV entertained itself

'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous paces bracing for bad news
And then the nurse comes round and everyone lifts their head
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said:
That love is watching someone die

So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?
So who's gonna watch you die?"

""I don't love you like I did yesterday?""

So sick and tired of all the needless beating
But baby, when they knock you down and out
Is where you ought to stay

Another dollar's just another blow
So fix your eyes and get up
Better get up while you can, whoa, whoa, whoa

No longer easy on the eyes but these wrinkles masterfully disguise
The youthful boy below
Who turned your way and saw something he was not looking for
Both a beginning and an end
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize when he catches his reflection on accident

On the back of a motorbike with your arms outstretched trying to take flight, leaving everything behind
But even at our swiftest speed we couldn't break from the concrete
In the city where we still reside
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
For the sea like navy men
Cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides
Like brothers on a hotel bed

And holding fast to truth
Don't wanna lose what I had as a boy
My heart still has a beat
But love is now a feat
As common as a cold day in LA

Sometimes when I'm alone, I wonder
Is there a spell that I am under
Keeping me from seeing the real thing?

Love hurts
But sometimes it’s a good hurt
And it feels like I'm alive
Love sings
When it transcends the bad things
Have a heart and try me
'Cause without love, I won't survive

Stand naked and accused
Should I surface this one-man submarine?

I find the map and draw a straight line
Over rivers, farms, and state lines
The distance from ""A"" to where you'd be
It's only finger-lengths that I see
I touch the place
Where I'd find your face
My fingers in creases
Of distant dark places

[Verse 2]
I hang my coat up in the first bar
There is no peace that I've found so far
The laughter penetrates my silence
As drunken men find flaws in science
Their words, mostly noises
Ghosts with just voices
Your words in my memory
Are like music to me

[Chorus]
And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground
And I, I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms

[Verse 3]
After I have traveled so far
We'd set the fire to the third bar
We'd share each other like an island
Until exhausted, close our eyelids
And dreaming, pick up from
The last place we left off
Your soft skin is weeping
A joy you can't keep in

[Chorus]
And miles from where you are
I lay down on the cold ground
And I, I pray that something picks me up
And sets me down in your warm arms
And miles from where you are

And I'll put my hands over your eyes, but you'll peep through

And sun, sun, sun  all down our necks
And there'll sun, sun, sun  all over our faces
And sun, sun, sun - so what the heck!

And we'll be laughing about how we used to smoke
All those stupid little cigarettes and drink stupid wine
'Cause it's what we needed to have a good time

But it was fun, fun, fun when we were drinking
It was fun, fun, fun when we were drunk
And it was fun, fun, fun when we were laughing
It was fun, fun, fun; oh it was fun

It's the happiest that I've ever been
And I'll say I no longer feel I have to be James Dean
And she'll say ""Yeah, well, I feel all pretty happy too
And I'm always pretty happy when I'm just kicking back with you""

And love, love, love all through our minds
And it'll be love, love, love all over her face
And love, love, love all over mine

Although maybe all these moments are just in my head
I'll be thinking about them as I'm lying in bed
And all that I believe, it might not even come true
But in my mind I'm havin' a pretty good time with you

In five years time, I might not know you
In five years time, we might not speak
In five years time, we might not get along
In five years time, you might just prove me wrong

202,203,Do You Remember,Jack Johnson,In Between Dreams,3/1/2005,"Do you remember when we first met? I sure do
It was some time in early September
Though you were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind

So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on it
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon

Well I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all is over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
Let's Rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are

We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at

Well all these times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind, we're locked in time
But you're still mine
Do you remember?"

Two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
The only girl I've ever loved
Was born with roses in her eyes
But then they buried her alive
One evening, 1945
With just her sister at her side
And only weeks before the guns
All came and rained on everyone
Now she's a little boy in Spain
Playing pianos filled with flames
On empty rings around the sun
All sing to say my dream has come

[Chorus]
But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

[Verse 2]
And now we ride the circus wheel
With your dark brother wrapped in white
Says it was good to be alive
But now he rides a comet's flame
And won't be coming back again
The Earth looks better from a star
That's right above from where you are
He didn't mean to make you cry
With sparks that ring and bullets fly
On empty rings around your heart
The world just screams and falls apart

[Chorus]
But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

[Verse 3]
And here's where your mother sleeps
And here is the room where your brothers were born
Indentions in the sheets
Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore
And it's so sad to see the world agree
That they'd rather see their faces filled with flies
All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes"
214,215,When I Was Your Man,Bruno Mars,Unorthodox Jukebox,1/15/2013,"[Verse 1]
Same bed but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Verse 2]
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made (oh)
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize

[Chorus]
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man

[Bridge]
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know

[Chorus]
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man

[Outro]
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man"

If I don't say this now, I will surely break
As I'm leaving the one I wanna take
Forgive the urgency, but hurry up and wait
My heart has started to separate

[Hook]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, be my baby
I'll look after you

[Verse 2]
There now, steady love, so few come and don't go
Will you, won't you be the one I'll always know?
When I'm losing my control, the city spins around
You're the only one who knows, you slow it down

My love, she leans into me
This most assuredly counts
She says most assuredly

I'll look after you
After you

I didn't know where to turn to
See, somehow I can't forget you
After all that we've been through

[Pre-Chorus]
Going, coming
Thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know
If you didn't notice, you mean everything
Quickly I'm learning to love again
All I know is I'mma be okay

Thought I couldn't live without you

I'm gonna smile 'cause I deserve to

I couldn't turn on the TV
Without something there to remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?

[Pre-Chorus: Leona Lewis]
If I'm dreaming, don't wanna laugh
Hurt my feelings, but that's the path
I believe in, and I know that time will heal it
If you didn't notice, boy, you meant everything

Since there's no more you and me (no more you and me)

And live my life how it should be (and I know, and I know)
No matter how hard it is, I'll be fine without you
Yes, I will!

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals, too

This is our last goodbye
I hate to feel the love between us die
But it's over, just hear this and then I'll go
You gave me more to live for, more than you'll ever know

[Verse 2]
Well, this is our last embrace
Must I dream and always see your face?
Why can't we overcome this wall?
Baby, maybe it's just because I didn't know you at all

Kiss me, please kiss me
Kiss me out of desire, baby, not consolation
Oh, you know it makes me so angry cause I know that in time
I'll only make you cry, this is our last goodbye, ohhh

Ooooh
Ooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

[Verse 4]
Did you say, ""No, this can't happen to me!""
Did you rush to the phone to call
Was there a voice unkind
In the back of your mind
Saying maybe
You didn't know him at all
You didn't know him at all, oh oh, ya didn't know
Ooohh, didn't know

Well, the bells out in the church tower chime
Burning clues into this heart of mine
Thinking so hard on her soft eyes
And the memories, offer signs that it's over
It's over"

All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey?

These people aren't your friends
They're paid to kiss your feet
They don't know what I know
And why should you care, when I'm not there?

What is there to moon glow, when love has passed you by
Then there came a midnight and the world was new
Now here am I so spellbound, darling
Not by stars, but just by you

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you
I found a dream that I can speak to
A dream that I can call my own
I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known
You smiled and then the spell was cast
And here we are in Heaven
For you are mine at last

At last my love has come along
My lonely days are over and life is like a song
At last the skies above are blue
My heart was wrapped in clover the night I looked at you

I found a thrill to press my cheek to
A thrill I've never known

There is a tree as old as me
Branches were sewn by the color of green
Ground had arose and passed its knees

I climbed the tree to see the world
When the gusts came around to blow me down
Held on as tightly as you held onto me
Held on as tightly as you held onto me

So why don't we just move into the other room
There's space for us to shake
And hey, I like this tune

[Verse 2]
Even if I could hear what you said
I doubt my reply would be interesting for you to hear
Because I haven't read a single book all year
And the only film I saw
I didn't like it at all

[Chorus]
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance
Than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance
Than talk with you
I'd rather dance, I'd rather dance
Than talk with you

[Verse 3]
The music's too loud and the noise from the crowd
Increases the chance of misinterpretation
So let your hips do the talking
I'll make you laugh by acting like the guy who sings
And you'll make me smile by really
Getting into the swing

[Bridge]
Getting into the swing
Getting into the swing
Getting into the swing
Getting into the swing

Tied to me tight, tie me up again

Into your heart I'll beat again
Sweet like candy to my soul

Hike up your skirt a little more

Ooh, oh oh
Sweet love, yeah

[Verse 1]
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself
I couldn’t have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn’t know you, 'cause I didn’t know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The feeling that I’m feeling now that I don’t hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips ‘cause I don’t have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn’t give to have you lying by my side
Right here, ’cause baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night, when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute, this is too deep (Too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
""I only think of you""
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, cryin' tryin'
To figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

[Chorus]
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we found
Safely walk to school without a sound

There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms

Nouns, and books, and show and tell

We don't notice anything
We sit side by side in every class
Teacher thinks that I sound funny
But she likes the way you sing

When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive

[Pre-Chorus]
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home

And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya

Inside the necklace you got when you were 16

Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go

Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone

That this old dog kicked up
It's been raining since you left me
Now I'm drowning in the flood

But without you I give up
Now I can't sing a love song
Like the way it's meant to be
Well, I guess I'm not that good anymore

Are just memories of a different life
Some that made us laugh, some that made us cry
One that made you have to say goodbye
What I'd give to run my fingers through your hair
To touch your lips, to hold you near
When you say your prayers try to understand
I've made mistakes, I'm just a man
When he holds you close, when he pulls you near
When he says the words you've been needing to hear
I'll wish I was him cause those words are mine
To say to you till the end of time

In these loaded dice
But baby if you give me just one more try
We can pack up our old dreams
And our old lives
We'll find a place where the sun still shines

And I'll be there forever and a day, always

He deals the cards as a meditation

The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance

I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art

He may lay the queen of spades
He may conceal a king in his hand

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly (Lovely Rita)
When are you free to take some tea with me? (Lovely Rita maid! Ahh-ah-ah)

[Bridge]
Rita!

[Verse 2: Paul McCartney]
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you

For us to work, we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn, how to bend without the world caving in

That she is beautiful
But she don't mean a thing to me
Yeah, she is beautiful
But she don't mean a thing to me

I spent two weeks in Silver Lake
The California sun
Cascading down my face
There was a girl with light brown streaks
And she was beautiful
But she didn't mean a thing to me
Yeah, she was beautiful
But she didn't mean a thing to me

I wanted to believe in all the words that I was speaking
As we moved together in the dark
And all the friends that I was telling
All the playful misspellings
Every bite I gave you left a mark
And tiny vessels oozed into your neck
And formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade
But they did, and so did I that day

All I see are dark grey clouds
In the distance, moving closer with every hour
So when you ask, ""Is something wrong?""
I think, ""You're damn right there is
But we can't talk about it now""
No, we can't talk about it now

So one last touch, and then you'll go
And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more

So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowing when to stop
Sunglasses indoors, par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sipping a drink and laughing at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going

Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Knowing full well that I don't
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want ya
To do me no good
And you look like you could

Who's still around the morning after
We broke up a month ago and I grew up I didn't know
I'd be around the morning after

It's always been wait and see
A happy day and then you pay
And feel like shit the morning after
But now I feel changed around and instead of falling down
I'm standing up the morning after

Situations get fucked up and turned around sooner or later
And I could be another fool or an exception to the rule
You tell me the morning after

Crooked spin can't come to rest
I'm damaged bad at best
She'll decide what she wants
I'll probably be the last to know
No one says until it shows, see how it is
They want you or they don't
Say yes

Who's still around the morning after"

We would dance all night, play our music loud
But when we grew up, nothing was what it seemed

[Chorus]
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?
I can be your china doll if you like to see me fall
Boy, you're so dope, your love is deadly
Tell me life is beautiful, they think that I have it all
I've nothing without you
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you
Hello? Hello?
Ca-can you hear me?

Nothing without you

Nothing if I can't have you"

To see you when I wake up
Is a gift I didn't think could be real
To know that you feel the same as I do
Is a three-fold utopian dream

You do something to me that I can't explain
So would I be out of line if I said I miss you?

I see your picture
I smell your skin on the empty pillow next to mine
You have only been gone ten days
But already I'm wasting away

[Chorus]
I know I'll see you again, whether far or soon
But I need you to know that I care and I miss you"

You've got this look I can't describe

Without a doubt you're on my side

Can't find the words to write this song
Oh...

Breathe in for luck, breathe in so deep

This night is wild, so calm and dull
These hearts, they race, from self control
Your legs are smooth as they graze mine

My hopes are so high that your kiss might kill me
So won't you kill me, so I die happy?
My heart is yours to fill or burst
To break or bury

The words are hushed, let's not get busted
Just lay entwined here, undiscovered
Safe in here from all the stupid questions
""Hey, did you get some?""

Stay quiet, stay near, stay close, they can't hear
So we can get some

Hands down, this is the best day
I can ever remember
I'll always remember the sound
Of the stereo, the dim of the soft lights
The scent of your hair that you twirled in your fingers
And the time on the clock when we realized it's so late
And this walk that we shared together
The streets were wet, and the gate was locked
So I jumped it and I let you in
And you stood at your door with your hands on my waist
And you kissed me like you meant it
And I knew that you meant it
That you meant it, that you meant it
And I knew that you meant it
That you meant it"

You are driving me home
Then looking upwards
I strain my eyes and try
To tell the difference between
Shooting stars and satellites
From the passenger seat as
You are driving me home
""Do they collide?"" I ask
And you smile
With my feet on the dash
The world doesn't matter
When you feel embarrassed
Then I'll be your pride
If you need directions
Then I'll be the guide

My airspace

Wondering in the night, what were the chances?
We'd be sharing love before the night was through

Something in your eyes was so inviting
Something in your smile was so exciting
Something in my heart told me I must have you

Strangers in the night
Two lonely people, we were strangers in the night
Up to the moment when we said our first hello, little did we know
Love was just a glance away, a warm embracing dance away and

Ever since that night we've been together
Lovers at first sight, in love forever
It turned out so right for strangers in the night

Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day
I need some distraction
Oh beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh, and weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here

[Verse 2]
So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
And the storm keeps on twisting
You keep on building the lie
That you make up for all that you lack
It don't make no difference
Escaping one last time
It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh
This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees

In the arms of the angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie

You're in the arms of the angel
May you find some comfort here"

Here I stand head in hand
Turn my face to the wall
If she's gone I can't go on
Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say

[Chorus]
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say

Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away"

So little to say but so much time
Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind
Please wear the face, the one where you smile
Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry

Forgive me, first love, but I'm tired
I need to get away to feel again
Try to understand why
Don't get so close to change my mind
Please wipe that look out of your eyes
It's bribing me to doubt myself
Simply, it's tiring

[Verse 2]
This love has dried up, and stayed behind
And if I stay I'll be a lie
Then choke on words I'd always hide
Excuse me, first love, but we're through
I need to taste the kiss from someone new
Forgive me, first love, but I'm too tired
I'm bored to say the least and I, I lack desire

Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love
Forgive me, first love, forgive me, first love, forgive me

And we will never, ever, ever be apart

Said ""There’s another,"" and looked right in my eyes

There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above

She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

You got, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, it's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else..."

Girl, I understand why
See, it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta do
But that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that, I... love you, I just...
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to let it go now
Than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

[Verse 1]
It's gonna burn for me to say this, but it's coming from my heart
It's been a long time coming, but we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out, but I don't think you're gonna change
I do, but you don't, think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting, baby, I ain't happy, baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn

[Verse 2]
Sending pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feeling ain't the same
Find myself calling her your name
Ladies, tell me do you understand?
Now, all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't coming back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Oh oh oh oh
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burning 'til you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn (gotta let it burn), gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn, let it burn, gotta let it burn

[Bridge]
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, oooh
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is telling me that I need to move on
On the other side, I wanna break down and cry, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (can you hear me burning?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burning 'til you return (let it burn)

[Chorus]
When your feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumping like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (let it burn, let it burn), let it burn, gotta let it burn
Deep down, you know it's best for yourself, but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through

And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first

How wonderful life is now you're in the world"
368,369,Lilac Wine,Jeff Buckley,Grace,8/23/1994,"I lost myself on a cool, damp night
Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree
I made wine from the lilac tree
Put my heart in its recipe
It makes me see what I want to see
And be what I want to be
When I think more than I want to think
Do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, like my love
Listen to me... I cannot see clearly
Isn't that she coming to me nearly here

Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?
Listen to me, why is everything so hazy?
Isn't that she, or am I just going crazy, dear?

Lilac wine, I feel unready for my love
Feel unready for my love"

Looking out the door I see the rain
Fall upon the funeral mourners
Parading in a wake of sad relations
As their shoes fill up with water
Maybe I'm too young
To keep good love from going wrong
But tonight you're on my mind
So you never know

[Verse 2]
Broken down and hungry for your love
With no way to feed it
Where are you tonight, child
You know how much I need it
Too young to hold on
And too old to just break free and run

[Verse 3]
Sometimes a man gets carried away
When he feels like he should be having his fun
And much too blind to see the damage he's done
Sometimes a man must awake to find that really, he has no-one
So I'll wait for you, and I'll burn
Will I ever see your sweet return
Oh, will I ever learn?

[Chorus]
Oh lover, you should've come over
Cause it's not too late

[Verse 4]
Lonely is the room, the bed is made
The open window lets the rain in
Burning in the corner is the only one
Who dreams he had you with him
My body turns and yearns
For a sleep that will never come
It's never over
My kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder
It's never over
All my riches for her smiles when I slept so soft against her
It's never over
All my blood for the sweetness of her laughter
It's never over
She's the tear that hangs inside my soul forever
Well maybe I'm just too young
To keep good love from going wrong

[Chorus]
Oh... Ohh... Ohhhhh... Ohhhhhh...
Ohh..... lover, you should've come over
Yes, yes, I feel too young to hold on
And I'm much too old to break free and run
Too deaf, dumb, and blind to see the damage I've done
Sweet lover, you should've come over
Oh, love well I'm waiting for you
Lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover you should've come over
Cause it's not too late"

At this old piano
Trying hard to capture
The moment this morning I don't know
Cause a bottle of Vodka
Is still lodged in my head
And some blonde gave me nightmares
I think that she's still in my bed
As I dream about movies
They won't make of me when I'm dead
With an ironclad fist I wake up and
French kiss the morning
While some marching band keeps
Its own beat in my head
While we're talking
About all of the things that I long to believe
About love and the truth and
What you mean to me
And the truth is baby you're all that I need...

For tonight I sleep on a bed of nails
Oh I want to be just as close as the Holy Ghost is
And lay you down on a bed of roses

That each step that I take is on my way home
A king's ransom in dimes I'd given each night
Just to see through this payphone
Still I run out of time
Or it's hard to get through
Till the bird on the wire flies me back to you
I'll just close my eyes and whisper
Baby blind love is true

Know I'll be thinking about you
While my mistress she calls me

For it's you that I'd die to defend

Just to be with you

It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we've got this far
And can you feel the love tonight? (Tonight)
How it's laid to rest?
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best
There's a time for everyone
If they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope
Moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason
To the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager
Beats in time with yours

385,386,Only One,Yellowcard,Beyond Ocean Avenue: Live at the Electric Factory,1/25/2005,"[Verse 1]
Broken this fragile thing now
And I can't, I can't pick up the pieces
And I've thrown my words all around
But I can't, I can't give you a reason
I feel so broken up (so broken up)
And I give up (I give up)
I just want to tell you so you know

[Chorus]
Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one

[Verse 2]
Made my mistakes, let you down
And I can't, I can't hold on for too long
Ran my whole life in the ground
And I can't, I can't get up when you're gone
And something's breaking up (breaking up)
I feel like giving up (like giving up)
I won't walk out until you know

[Chorus]
Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one that gets me like you do
You are my only, my only one

[Verse 3]
Here I go, so dishonestly
Leave a note for you, my only one
And I know you can see right through me
So let me go and you will find someone

[Outro]
Here I go, scream my lungs out and try to get to you
You are my only one
I let go, there's just no one, no one like you
You are my only, my only one
My only one

My only one
You are my only, my only one"

Well I had a dream
I stood beneath an orange sky
Yes, I had a dream
I stood beneath an orange sky
With my brother standing by
With my brother standing by

It's a long road we've been walking on
Yes it is, yes it is, you know, brother it is

Goes like this
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love

In your love
In your love
In your love

[Bridge]
Oh, but you know I am so weary
And you know
My heart, my heart's been broken now
Sometimes
Sometimes
My mind is too strong to carry on
Too strong, too strong to carry on

[Verse 3]
But when I am alone
When I've thrown off the weight of this crazy stone
When I've lost all care for the things I own
That's when I miss you
That's when I miss you
You who are my home
You who are my home now

[Chorus 3]
And here is what I know now, brother
Here is what I know now, sister
Goes like this
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
My salvation lies
In your love
In your love
In your love
Your love now

Well, I had a dream
I stood beneath an orange sky

Watch your mouth, oh, oh, oh
Because your speech is slurred enough
That you just might swallow your tongue
I'm sure you would want to give up the ghost
With just a little more poise than that

Running late? Oh no, he called in
Or was it God who chokes in these situations
Running late? Oh no, he called in

Damn their lies

I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Verse 2]
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same

[Bridge]
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

[Verse 3]
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere

Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight

Tied to a night they never met
You know it's time that we grow old and do some shit
I like it all that way
I like it all that way

All these people drinking lover's spit
Swallowing words while giving head
They listen to teeth to learn how to quit

Can't count the years on one hand
That we've been together

Can't deny, can't deny you're worth it

Yeah after all this time I'm still into you

[Verse 2]
Recount the night that I first met your mother
And on the drive back to my house
I told you that, I told you that I loved ya

She says it helps with the lights out
Her rabid glow is like braille to the night
She swears I’m a slave to the details
But if your life is such a big joke, why should I care?

The clock is set for nine but you know you’re gonna make it eight
So that you two can take some time, teach each other to reciprocate

[Verse 2]
She feels that my sentimental side should be held with kids' gloves
But she doesn’t know that I left my urge in the icebox
She swears I’m just prey for the female
Well then hook me up and throw me, baby cakes, 'cause I like to get hooked

[Chorus]
The clock is set for nine but you know you’re gonna make it eight
All the people that you’ve loved, they’re all bound to leave some keepsakes
I’ve been swinging all the time, think it’s time I learned your way
I picture you and me together in the jungle, it would be ok

[Break]
I’ll bring you when my lifeboat sails through the night
That is supposing that you don’t sleep tonight

It’s like learning a new language
Helps me catch up on my mime
If you don’t bring up those lonely parts
This could be a good time
It’s like learning a new language

You come here to me
We’ll collect those lonely parts and set them down
You come here to me

397,398,You And I Both,Jason Mraz,Waiting for My Rocket to Come,3/2/2004,"[Verse 1]
Was it you who spoke the words that things would happen but not to me
Oh, things are gonna happen naturally
Oh, taking your advice and I'm looking on the bright side
And balancing the whole thing
Oh, but often times those words get tangled up in lines
And the bright lights turn to night
Oh, until the dawn it brings
Another day to sing about the magic that was you and me

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
Others only read of the love, the love that I love, yeah
(Da da da da)

[Verse 2]
See, I'm all about them words
Over numbers, unencumbered numbered words
Hundreds of pages, pages, pages for words
More words than I had ever heard and I feel so alive

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Oh, love, love
You and I, you and I
Not so little, you and I, anymore, mmm

[Verse 3]
And with this silence brings a moral story
More importantly evolving is the glory of a boy

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well, I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of
Finally de de de de de
Well I'm almost finally, finally
Well, I'm free, oh, I'm free

[Bridge]
And it's okay if you have to go away
Oh, just remember the telephone works both ways
But if I never ever hear them ring
If nothing else, I'll think the bells inside
Have finally found you someone else and that's okay
'Cause I'll remember everything you sang

[Chorus]
'Cause you and I both loved
What you and I spoke of
And others just read of
And if you could see me now
Well, then I'm almost finally out of
I'm finally out of, finally de de de de de de
Well, I'm almost finally, finally, out of words"

You cool your bedwarm hands down
On the broken radiator
When you lay them freezing on me
I mumble can you wake me later
But I don't really want you to stop
And you know it so it doesn't stop you
You run your hands from my neck
To my chest

[Chorus]
Crack the shutters open wide
I want to bathe you in the light of day
And just watch you as the rays
Tangle up around your face and body
I could sit for hours
Finding new ways to be awed each minute
'Cause the daylight seems to want you
Just as much as I want you

[Verse 2]
It's been minutes it's been days
It's been all I will remember
Happy lost in your hair
And the cold side of the pillow
Your hills and valleys
Are mapped by my intrepid fingers
And in a naked slumber
I dream all this again

[Chorus]
Crack the shutters open wide
I want to bathe you in the light of day
And just watch you as the rays
Tangle up around your face and body
I could sit for hours
Finding new ways to be awed each minute
'Cause the daylight seems to want you
Just as much as I want you

[Chorus]
Crack the shutters open wide
I want to bathe you in the light of day
And just watch you as the rays
Tangle up around your face and body
I could sit for hours
Finding new ways to be awed each minute
'Cause the daylight seems to want you
Just as much as I want you"

Something always brings me back to you
It never takes too long
No matter what I say or do
I'll still feel you here until the moment I'm gone
You hold me without touch
You keep me without chains
I never wanted anything so much
Than to drown in your love and not feel your rain

[Chorus]
Set me free
Leave me be
I don't wanna fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me

[Verse 2]
Oh, you loved me 'cause I'm fragile
When I thought that I was strong
But you touch me for a little while
And all my fragile strength is gone

[Chorus]
Set me free
Leave me be
I don't wanna fall another moment into your gravity
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be
But you're on to me and all over me

[Verse 3]
I live here on my knees
As I try to make you see
That you're everything I think I need here on the ground
But you're neither friend nor foe
Though I can't seem to let you go

Your fingertips across my skin
The palm trees swaying in the wind
Images
You sang me Spanish lullabies
The sweetest sadness in your eyes, clever trick

Well, I'd never want to see you unhappy
I thought you'd want the same for me

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream

Can't you just let me be?

So long, my luckless romance
My back is turned on you
Should've known you'd bring me heartache
Almost lovers always do

We walked along a crowded street
You took my hand and danced with me images
And when you left you kissed my lips
You told me you would never ever forget these images, no

I thought you'd want the same for me

I cannot go to the ocean
I cannot drive the streets at night
I cannot wake up in the morning
Without you on my mind

So you're gone and I'm haunted
And I bet you are just fine
Did I make it that easy to walk
Right in and out of my life?

Goodbye, my almost lover
Goodbye, my hopeless dream
I'm trying not to think about you
Why can't you just let me be?

So long, my luckless romance

I leaned on the wall and the wall leaned away
Can I get a minute of not being nervous
And not thinking of my dick?

You could drive a car through my head in five minutes
From one side of it to the other

She was, uh, on an airplane and
She's flying to meet her fiancé
Sailing high above the, the largest ocean
On planet earth and she was seated
Next to this man who, you know
She had tried to start conversations
And only, really the only thing
She'd heard him say was to order his bloody mary
And she's sitting there and she's reading
This really arduous magazine article about a
Third world country that she couldn't
Even pronounce the-the name of and
She's feeling very bored and very despondent
And then uh, suddenly there's this huge mechanical failure and one of the engines gave out
And they started just falling, thirty thousand feet
And the pilot's on the microphone and he's, he's saying
""I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Oh My God, I'm Sorry""
And apologizing and, and she looks at the man and she says, she says, she says
""Where are we going?"" and he looks at her and he says
""We're going to a party, it, it's a birthday party
It's your birthday party, happy birthday darling
We love you very, very, very, very, very, very, very much.""

We must rip out all the epilogues from the books that we have read
Into the face of every criminal strapped firmly to a chair
We must stare, we must stare, we must stare

We must take all of the medicines too expensive now to sell
Set fire to the preacher who is promising us Hell
Into the ear of every anarchist that sleeps but doesn't dream
We must sing, we must sing, we must sing

We must blend into the choir, sing as static with the whole
We must memorize nine numbers and deny we have a soul
And in this endless race for property and privilege to be won
We must run, we must run, we must run

We must hang up in the belfry where the bats and moonlight laugh
We must stare into a crystal ball and only see the past
Into the caverns of tomorrow with just our flashlights and our love
We must plunge, we must plunge, we must plunge

And then we'll see it, we'll see it, we'll see it)

Well, I was there on the day they sold the cause for the queen
And when the lights all went out, we watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself, but it started with an alright scene
It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
It was a lie when they smiled and said, ""You won't feel a thing""
And as we ran from the cops we laughed so hard, it would sting

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, whoa, if I'm so wrong (So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter after I'm gone?
Because you never learned a goddamn thing

[Chorus]
You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

[Verse 2]
I spent my high school career spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on TV
Bring out the old guillotine, we'll show them what we all mean

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, whoa, if I'm so wrong (So wrong, so wrong)
How can you listen all night long? (Night long, night long)
Now, will it matter long after I'm gone?

You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you

So go, go away
Just go, run away
But where did you run to? And where did you hide?
Go find another way, price you pay...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

You're just a sad song with nothing to say
About a life-long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that I'm wrong
This never meant nothing to you, come on!

About a life-long wait for a hospital stay

Sometimes I find myself sitting back and reminiscing
Especially when I have to watch other people kissing
And I remember when you started calling me your missus
All the play fighting, all the flirtatious disses
I'd tell you sad stories about my childhood
I don't know why I trusted you, but I knew that I could
We'd spend the whole weekend lying in our own dirt
I was just so happy in your boxers and your t-shirt

[Pre-Chorus]
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of you and me
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you have the same dreams too

[Chorus]
The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame, but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair
That the things are reminding me of you
Sometimes I wish we could just pretend
Even if only for one weekend
So come on, tell me
Is this the end?

[Verse 2]
Drinking tea in bed, watching DVD's
When I discovered all your dirty grotty magazines
You take me out shopping and all we'd buy is trainers
As if we ever needed anything to entertain us
The first time that you introduced me to your friends
And you could tell I was nervous, so you held my hand
When I was feeling down, you made that face you do
There's no one in the world who could replace you

[Pre-Chorus]
Dreams, dreams
Of when we had just started things
Dreams of me and you
And it seems, it seems
That I can't shake those memories
I wonder if you feel the same way too

The littlest things that take me there
I know it sounds lame, but it's so true
I know it's not right, but it seems unfair

So come on, tell me

421,422,Same Love (feat. Mary Lambert),Macklemore & Ryan Lewis,Reflektor,7/18/2012,"[Piano Intro]

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

I still can't turn away
With all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Tossed along the way
Letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away

And now we're grown-up orphans
That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one
That's a shame
You could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

Scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are?

You grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history
A tired song keeps playing on a tired radio
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

I won't tell 'em your name

431,432,When A Man Loves A Woman,Percy Sledge,His Greatest Hits,4/16/1966,"When a man loves a woman
Can't keep his mind on nothin' else
He'd change the world for the good thing he's found
If she is bad, he can't see it
She can do no wrong
Turn his back on his best friend if he put her down

When a man loves a woman
He'll spend his very last dime
Tryin' to hold on to what he needs
He'd give up all his comforts
And sleep out in the rain
If she said that's the way
It ought to be

Well, this man loves you, woman
I gave you everything I had
Tryin' to hold on to your heartless love
Baby, please don't treat me bad

When a man loves a woman
Down deep in his soul
She can bring him such misery
If she is playin' him for a fool
He's the last one to know
Lovin' eyes can never see

When a man loves a woman
He can do her no wrong
He can never want
Some other girl

Yes when a man loves a woman
I know exactly how he feels
Cause baby, baby, you're my world

When a man loves a woman..."

Let's just fix this whole thing now

How I wish I could surrender my soul
Shed the clothes that become my skin
See the liar that burns within my needing
How I wish I'd chosen darkness from cold
How I wish I had screamed out loud
Instead I've found no meaning

I guess it's time I run far, far away
Find comfort in pain
All pleasure's the same: it just keeps me from trouble
Hides my true shape, like Dorian Gray
I've heard what they say, but I'm not here for trouble
It's more than just words: it's just tears and rain

How I wish I could walk through the doors of my mind

Help me understand the years
How I wish I could choose between Heaven and Hell
How I wish I would save my soul
I'm so cold from fear

I picked you out
Of a crowd and talked to you
Said I liked your shoes
You said: ""Thanks, can I follow you?""
So it's up the stairs
And out of view, no prying eyes
I poured some wine
I asked your name, you asked the time

[Verse 2]
Now it's two o'clock
The club is closed, we're up the block
Your hands on me
I'm pressing hard against your jeans
Your tongue in my mouth
Trying to keep the words from coming out
You didn't care to know
Who else may have been you before

I want a lover I don't have to love
I want a girl who's too sad to give a fuck
Where's the kid with the chemicals?
I thought he said to meet me here but I'm not sure
I got the money if you got the time
You said it feels good; I said I'll give it a try

[Verse 4]
Then my mind went dark
We both forgot where your car was parked
Let's just take the train
I'll meet up with the band in the morning

Bad actors with bad habits
Some sad singers, they just play tragic
And the phone's ringing, and the van's leaving
Let's just keep touching
Let's just keep, keep singing

I want a lover I don't have to love
I want a boy who's so drunk he doesn't talk
Where's the kid with the chemicals?
I got a hunger and I can't seem to get full
I need some meaning I can memorize
The kind I have always seems to slip my mind

But you, but you
You write such pretty words
But life's no story book
Love's an excuse to get hurt
And to hurt

""I do, I do!""
""Then hurt me."""

Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it

Oh, I can't fight this feeling any longer
And yet, I'm still afraid to let it flow
What started out as friendship, has grown stronger
I only wish I had the strength to let it show
I tell myself that I can't hold out forever
I said there is no reason for my fear
'Cause I feel so secure when we're together
You give my life direction
You make everything so clear

You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night
And I'm getting closer than I ever thought I might

I've forgotten what I started fighting for
It's time to bring this ship into the shore
And throw away the oars, forever
Cause I can't fight this feeling anymore
I've forgotten what I started fighting for
And if I have to crawl upon the floor
Come crashing through your door
Baby, I can't fight this feeling anymore

[Verse 2]
My life has been such a whirlwind since I saw you
I've been running round in circles in my mind
And it always seems that I'm following you, girl
'Cause you take me to the places that, alone, I'd never find

And even as I wander, I'm keeping you in sight
You're a candle in the window on a cold, dark winter's night

And I don't know even where to start
Maybe that's a start

That you play, filling up your head with rain
And you know you've been hiding from your pain
In the way, in the way you say your name

And I see you
Hiding your face in your hands
Flying so you won't land
You think no one understands
No one understands

So you hunch your shoulders and you shake your head
And your throat is aching but you swear
No one hurts you, nothing could be said
Anyway you're not here enough to care

[Verse 5]
And you're so tired, you don't sleep at night
As your heart is trying to mend
You keep it quiet but you think you might
Disappear before the end

[Verse 6]
And it's strange how you cannot find
Any strength to even try
To find a voice to speak your mind
When you do, all you wanna do is cry
Well maybe you should cry

And I see you
Hiding your face in your hands
Talking 'bout far-away lands
You think no one understands
Listen to my hands

Moves around you
For all that you claim

And I'm just outside of Jersey, past the Palisades
And I'd love to see that ass in boots and shades
Throw down on the bed while I'm yanking your braids
Thug style, you never thought I'd make you smile
While I'm smacking your ass and fucking you all wild
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 2: Ja Rule]
Girl, get a grip, c'mon, pull it together
It's only a sunshower, we been through worse weather
Like the stormy nights you wrote a Dear Ja letter
And took my Benz and keyed and cut the leather
Bitch, you know better, we live M-O-B
Money over bitches, Murder, I-N-C
I got two or three hoes for every V
And I keep 'em drugged up off that ecstasy
I'm a playground legend like Kirkland Pee-wee
Name a nigga in the league got more game than me
I play hard, there's so many women I fathered
Meet 'em with scars and send 'em home hot and bothered
Truth or dare, this life ain't apparently fair
And a love with no glare is a crystal stare
But we share something so rare, but who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Verse 3: Ja Rule]
Oh, I'm feeling like you living a double life
Cause you don't be coming home sometimes
Baby, but you're always on time, checking for one time
You and I got a special bond together
We go back like bombers, boo, in the coldest weather
And when I play, you play the same way
You freak me, baby, I fuck you crazy, then I'm gone
Baby don't really want me to get up and leave off that easy
She'll be wakin' up wet for sheezy
Remind these bitches to mind they business
Believe me, this pimp game is very religious
And I'm built like the Don Bishop
Gon' keep this money-green Benz and my hoes as my witness
The life we share is a thug affair
But who cares, you care

[Chorus: Ashanti]
Baby, I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine
I'm not always there when you call, but I'm always on time
And I gave you my all, now baby, be mine

[Outro: Ashanti]
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine
Always there when you call, always on time
Gave you my, baby be mine

There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 1]
I never knew a luh, luh-luh, a love like this
Gotta be somethin' for me to write this
Queen, I ain't seen you in a minute
Wrote this letter, and finally decide to send it
Signed, sealed, delivered, for us to grow together
Love has no limit, let's spend it slow forever
I know your heart is weathered by what studs did to you
I ain't gon' assault them, ‘cause I probably did it too
Because of you, feelings I handle with care
Some niggas recognize the light
But they can't handle the glare
You know I ain't the type to walk around with matchin' shirts
If relationship is effort I will match your work
I want to be the one to make you happiest
And hurt you the most
They say the end is near, it's important that we close
To the most high
Regardless of what happen, on Him let's rely

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 2]
It's important we communicate
And tune the fate of this union to the right pitch
I never call you my bitch or even my boo
There's so much in a name and so much more in you
Few understand the union of woman and man
And sex and a tingle is where they assume that it land
But that's fly by night, for you in the sky I write
For in these cold Chi night's moon, you my light
If Heaven had a height, you would be that tall
Ghetto to coffee shop, through you I see that all
Let's stick to understandin' and we won't fall
For better or worse times, I hope to me you call
So I pray every day more than anything
Friends we'll stay as we begin to lay
This foundation for a family, love ain't simple
Why can't it be anything worth havin' you work at annually?
Granted we known each other for some time
It don't take a whole day to recognize sunshine

[Hook]
There are times
When you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

[Verse 3]
It's kind of fresh you listen to more than hip-hop
And I can catch you in the mix from beauty to thrift shop
Plus you shit pop when it's time to
Thinkin' you fresh, suggestin' beats I should rhyme to
At times when I'm lost I try to find you
You know to give me space when it's time to
My heart's dictionary defines you, it's love and happiness
Truthfully it's hard tryin' to practice abstinence
The time we committed love, it was real good
Had to be for me to arrive and it still feel good
I know the sex ain't gon' keep you
But as my equal, it's how I must treat you
As my reflection in light I'ma lead you
And whatever's right I'ma feed you
Digga-da, digga-da, digga-da, digga-digga-da-da
Yo, I tell you the rest when I see you; peace!

Yeah, I don't know if I can face the night
I'm in tears, and the cryin' that I do is for you

I want your love - let's break the walls between us
Don't make it tough - I'll put away my pride
Enough's enough, I've suffered and I've seen the light
Baby

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right

Don't know what I'm going to do
About this feeling inside
Yes it's true - loneliness took me for a ride

Without your love - I'm nothing but a begger
Without your love - a dog without a bone
What can I do? I'm sleeping in this bed alone

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight
You're my angel
Come and make it all right

You're the reason I live
You're the reason I die
You're the reason I give
When I break down and cry
Don't need no reason why

You're my angel
Come and save me tonight

No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of Spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day
No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday, within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

[Verse 2]
No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies
No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

[Chorus]
I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

You'd always love me like you did back then

Started making his way past 2 in the morning

Leaning now into the breeze
Remembering Sunday, he falls to his knees
They had breakfast together
But two eggs don't last
Like the feeling of what he needs

Now this place seems familiar to him
She pulled on his hand with a devilish grin
She led him upstairs, she led him upstairs
Left him dying to get in

Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night
I don't mean to be a bother
But have you seen this girl?
She's been running through my dreams
And it's driving me crazy, it seems
I'm gonna ask her to marry me

[Verse 2]
And even though she doesn't believe in love
He's determined to call her bluff
Who could deny these butterflies?
They're filling his gut
Waking the neighbors, unfamiliar faces
He pleads, though he tries
But he's only denied
Now he's dying to get inside

Forgive me, I'm trying to find
My calling, I'm calling at night

Are following me in my desperate endeavor
To find my whoever, wherever she may be

I'm terrified to speak (I'm not calling, I'm not calling)
But you'd expect that from me

Washing you out of my hair and out of my mind
Keeping an eye on the world
From so many thousands of feet off the ground
I'm over you now, I'm at home in the clouds
And towering over your head

512,513,What's Love Got to Do With It,Tina Turner,All the Best,5/29/1984,"[Verse 1]
You must understand though the touch of your hand
Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that

[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

[Verse 2]
It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace
I've got cause to be
There's a name for it
There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me

[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

[Bridge]
I've been taking on a new direction
But I have to say
I've been thinking about my own protection
It scares me to feel this way

[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a sweet old-fashioned notion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

[Chorus]
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

What's love?
Got to do it
Got to do it

Just having one of those days yeah
Didn't know what to do

It's five o'clock in the morning
Conversation got boring
You said you'd go into bed soon
So I snuck off to your bedroom
And I thought I'd just wait there
Until I heard you come up the stairs
And I pretended I was sleeping
And I was hoping you would creep in, with me

[Verse 2]
Put your arm around my shoulder
And it was if the room got colder
And we moved closer in together
And started talking about the weather
You said tomorrow would be fun
And we could watch 'A Place in the Sun'
I didn't know where this was going
When you kissed me

[Chorus 1]
Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time
Watching telly, drinking wine
Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone
I no longer feel alone, no longer feel alone

[Verse 3]
I haven't left you for days now
And I'm becoming amazed how
You're quite affectionate in public
In fact your friend said it made her feel sick
And even though it's moving forward
There's just the right amount of awkward
And today you accidentally called me ""Baby""

[Chorus 1]
Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time
Watching telly, drinking wine
Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone
I no longer feel alone, no longer feel alone

[Chorus 2]
Let's just stay, let's just stay
I wanna lie in bed all day
We'll be laughing all the way
You told your friends, they all know
We exist, but we're taking it slow
Let's just see how we go
Let's see how we go

[Chorus 1]
Are you mine? Are you mine?
'Cause I stay here all the time
Watching telly, drinking wine
Who'd have known? Who'd have known?
When you flash up on my phone
I no longer feel alone

Let's just stay, let's just stay
I wanna lie in bed all day

517,518,Those to Come,The Shins,Chutes Too Narrow,10/21/2003,"Eyeless in the morning sun you were
Pale and mild
A modern girl
Taken with thought, still prone to care
Making tea
In your underwear

You went out in the yard to find
Something to eat and clear your mind
Something bad inside me went away

Quaking leaves and broken light
Shifting skin
The coming night
The bearers of all good things arrive
Climb inside us
Twist and cry

A kiss on your molten eyes
Myriad lives like blades of grass
Yet to be realized - bow as they pass

They are cold
Still
Waiting in the ether to
Form
Feel
Kill
Propagate
Only to die

They are cold
Still
Waiting in the ether to
Form
Feel
Kill
Propagate
Only to die
Dissolve
Magically, absurdly
They'll end
Leave
Dissipate coldly
And strangely
Return"

There's blood in my mouth 'cause I've been biting my tongue all week

It's all a game of this or that, now versus then
Better off against worse for wear
And you're someone who knows someone who knows someone I once knew
And I just want to be a part of this
The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer and we are the dream
I could write it better than you ever felt it

[Chorus]
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

[Verse 2]
My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
A remix of your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it

So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too

I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
Vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part

Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Somebody
Told me that this planet was small, we used to live in
The same building, on the same floor, and never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour, and peeped this Ethiopian
Queen from Philly taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo, flash, focus, record
Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris at Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like, ""That shit don't matter."" When I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Telling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot
Starting building with her constantly round-the-clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep telling me…

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 2: Black Thought + Eve]
Yo, I'm the type that's always catching a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some old…  another lonely night
Seem like I'm on the side, you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper, daddy, keep that shit tight
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politicking with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty—psych
I'm playin', boo, you know it's just with you I'm staying, boo
And when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweating on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listening to your homies, they be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you saying, I can trust you? Is you crazy?! You my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering, ""She trying to play you for the fool, Black.""
If something's on your chest, then let it be known
See, I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some ""Oh, I'm a celebrity!""
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to their squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where their whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like…

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where

What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

Tied up in ancient history
I didn't believe in destiny
I look up, you're standing next to me

Let the rain fall, I don't care
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine
Suddenly, you're mine
And it's brighter than sunshine

I'd given up and given in
I just couldn't take the hurt again
What a feeling
I didn't have the strength to fight
Suddenly, it seemed so right
Me and you
What a feeling

What a feeling in my soul
Love burns brighter than sunshine
Brighter than sunshine
Let the rain fall, I don't care

It's brighter than the sun
It's brighter than the sun, sunshine

Love will remain a mystery
But give me your hand, and you will see
Your heart is keeping time with me

What a feeling in my soul
Love burns brighter than sunshine
It's brighter than sunshine
Let the rain fall, I don't care
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine
Suddenly, you're mine

Got a feeling in my soul
Love burns brighter than sunshine
It's brighter than sunshine
Let the rain fall, I don't care
I'm yours, and suddenly you're mine
Suddenly, you're mine

I got a feeling in my soul
Love burns brighter than sunshine

Let the rain fall, I don't care

Suddenly, you're mine

When I first saw you, I saw love
And the first time you touched me, I felt love
And after all this time
You're still the one I love
Mmm, yeah

Looks like we made it
Look how far we've come my baby
We mighta took the long way
We knew we'd get there someday

We're still together, still going strong

You're still the one I kiss goodnight

We beat the odds together
I'm glad we didn't listen

Down the corner of my street

There's a cold war coming
On the radio, I heard
Baby, it's a violent world

2 AM and she calls me 'cause I'm still awake
""Can you help me unravel my latest mistake?
I don't love him, winter just wasn't my season""
Yeah, we walk through the doors, so accusing their eyes
Like they have any right at all to criticize
Hypocrites, you're all here for the very same reason

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, girl
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

[Verse 2]
May he turned 21 on the base at Fort Bliss
""Just a day,"" he said down to the flask in his fist
Ain't been sober since maybe October of last year
Here in town, you can tell he's been down for a while
But my god, it's so beautiful when the boy smiles
Wanna hold him, maybe I'll just sing about it

[Chorus]
'Cause you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button, boys
So cradle your head in your hands
And breathe, just breathe
Oh, breathe, just breathe

There's a light at each end of this tunnel
You shout 'cause you're just as far in as you'll ever be out
And these mistakes you made, you'll just make them again
If you only try turning around

[Breakdown]
2 AM and I'm still awake, writing a song
If I get it all down on paper, it's no longer inside of me
Threatening the life it belongs to
And I feel like I'm naked in front of the crowd
'Cause these words are my diary screaming out loud
And I know that you'll use them, however you want to

[Chorus]
But you can't jump the track, we're like cars on a cable
And life's like an hourglass glued to the table
No one can find the rewind button now
Sing it if you understand

Swore I'd never fall in love again, but I fell hard
Guess I should have seen it coming; caught me by surprise
Wasn't looking where I was going; I fell into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You came into my crazy world like a cool and cleansing rain
Before I, I knew what hit me, baby, you were flowing through my veins

Lost in your eyes, drowning in blue
I'm out of control, what can I do?
I'm addicted to you

Midnight blows in through the window, dances 'round the room
Got me hypnotised, I'm getting high on the perfume
I couldn't live without you now, oh, I know I'd go insane
I wouldn't last one night alone, baby
I couldn't stand the pain

And the darkness is a clear view
Because you've come to rescue me

The smell of your skin lingers on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your hometown
I need some shelter of my own protection, baby
Be with myself and center
Clarity, peace, serenity

I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
It's personal, myself and I

And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket

And big girls don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

This time, I wonder what it feels like
To find the one in this life
The one we all dream of
But dreams just aren't enough
So I'll be waiting for the real thing
I'll know it by the feeling
The moment when we're meeting
Will play out like a scene
Straight off the silver screen
So I'll be holding my breath
Right up 'til the end
Until that moment when
I find the one that I'll spend forever with

[Chorus]
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
Someone to love with my life in their hands
There's gotta be somebody for me like that

And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
There's gotta be somebody for me out there

Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight
And dammit, this feels too right
It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you

I find the one that I'll spend forever with?

She holds a smile like someone would hold a crying child

'Cause your heart was dying fast, and you didn't know what to do

Cath, it seems that you live in someone else's dream
In a hand-me-down wedding dress
Where the things that could have been are oppressed
But you said your vows, and you closed the door
On so many men who would have loved you more

And soon everybody will ask what became of you
'Cause your heart was dying fast, and you didn't know what to do

The helicopters?

No need for words now
We sit in silence
You look me
In the eye directly
You met me

The evening
The mess we're in and

The city sun sets over me

Night and day
I dream of
Making love

And I have seen
The sunrise
Over the river
The freeway
Reminding
Of this mess we're in and

I just want to say (I just want to say)
Don't ever change now baby (Don't ever change)

And the city landscape comes into being

Can't help but wish that I was there
At where I'd love to be, oh yeah

Is to hold her when I'm not around
When I'm much too far away

And now I wish I'd stayed
'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired
I'm missing you again, oh no
Once again

There's nothing here for me, on this barren road
There's no one here while the city sleeps
And all the shops are closed
Can't help but think of the times I've had with you
Pictures and some memories will have to help me through, oh yeah

Dear God, the only thing I ask of you

When hope begins to fade

Singing ""Cathy's Clown""
That's the man she's married to now
That's the girl that he takes around town
She appears composed, so she is, I suppose
Who can really tell?
She shows no emotion at all
Stares into space like a dead china doll

I'm never gonna know you now
But I'm gonna love you anyhow

Now she's done and they're calling someone
Such a familiar name
I'm so glad that my memory's remote
Cause I'm doing just fine hour to hour, note to note
Here it is, the revenge to the tune:
You're no good
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Can't you tell that it's well-understood?

I'm never gonna know you now
But I'm gonna love you anyhow

I'm here today and expected to stay
On and on and on
I'm tired
I'm tired

Looking out on the substitute scene
Still going strong
XO, Mom
It's okay, it's alright, nothing's wrong
Tell Mr. Man with impossible plans
To just leave me alone
In the place where I make no mistakes
In the place where I have what it takes

As the cluttered streets greet me once again
I know I can't be late, supper's waiting on the table
Tomorrow's just an excuse away
So I pull my collar up and face the cold, on my own
The earth laughs beneath my heavy feet
At the blasphemy in my old jangly walk
Steeple guide me to my heart and home
The sun is out and up and down again

Wrapped up in the pleasures of the world

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now"

Pulling me into another dream

In the blue TV screen light

With your face sketched on it twice

I live in a box of paints
I'm frightened by the devil

""Love is touching souls""
Surely you touched mine
'Cause part of you pours out of me
In these lines from time to time

And see this for what it is
That we're not in love

Isn't the ending so much as the start

It was hard to tell just how I felt
To not recognize myself
I started to fade (away, away, away)

And after all it won't take long to fall (in love)
Now I know what I don't want
I learned that with you

To pray on, or wish on, or something like that

Whose reality I knew, was a hopeless to be had

And I believed for a moment that my chances
Were approaching to be grabbed
But as it came down near, so did a weary tear
I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag

And I went crazy again today
Looking for a strand to climb, looking for a little hope
Baby said he couldn't stay
Wouldn't put his lips to mine and a fail to kiss is a fail to cope
I said, ""Honey, I don't feel so good, don't feel justified
Come on put a little love here in my void,""
He said ""It's all in your head,""
And I said, ""So's everything"" but he didn't get it

I'd like to close my eyes, go numb
But there's a cold wind coming from
The top of the highest high-rise today
It's not a breeze cause it blows hard
Yes and it wants me to discard the humanity I know
Watch the warmth blow away

So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow old

So do you think I should adhere to that pressing new frontier?
And leave in my wake a trail of fear?
Or should I hold my head up high
And throw a wrench in spokes by
Leaving the air behind me clear?

So don't let the world bring you down
Not everyone here is that fucked up and cold
Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow old

Remember why you came and while you're alive
Experience the warmth before you grow old

This little light of mine and I'm finna let it shine
I'm finna take y'all back to them better times
I'm finna talk about my mama if y'all don't mind
I was three years old when you and I moved to the Chi
Late December, harsh winter gave me a cold
You fixed me up something that was good for my soul
Famous homemade chicken soup, can I have another bowl?
You work late nights just to keep on the lights
Mommy got me training wheels so I could keep on my bike
And you would give anything in this world
Michael Jackson leather and a glove, but didn't give me a curl
And you never put no man over me
And I love you for that, mommy, can't you see?
Seven years old, caught you with tears in your eyes
'Cause a nigga cheatin', telling you lies, then I started to cry
As we knelt on the kitchen floor
I said mommy I'ma love you 'til you don't hurt no more
And when I'm older, you ain't gotta work no more
And I'ma get you that mansion that we couldn't afford
See you're unbreakable, unmistakable
Highly capable, lady that's makin' loot
A livin' legend too, just look at what heaven do
Send us an angel, and I thank you (Hey Mama)

Things I gotta do, just to prove to you
You was getting through, can the choir, please
Give me a verse of ""You Are So Beautiful To Me""
Can't you see, you're like a book of poetry

Come on mommy just dance wit' me, let the whole world see your dancing feet

Second, they get up you gon get that Benzo
Tint the windows, ride around the city and let ya friends know (Hey Mama)
Tell your job you gotta fake em out
Since you brought me in this world, let me take you out
To a restaurant, upper echelon
I'ma get you a Jag, whatever else you want
Just tell me what kind of S-Type Donda West like?
Tell me the perfect color so I make it just right
It don't gotta be Mother's Day, or your birthday
For me to just call and say: (Hey Mama)

I wanna scream so loud for you, 'cause I'm so proud of you
Let me tell you what I'm about to do

Honest with the one that you love

So here's hoping I will not drown
Or paralyze in light
And godsend I don't want to go
To the seal's watershed

Hope there's someone who'll take care of me
When I die, will I go?
Hope there's someone who'll set my heart free
Nice to hold when I'm tired

Last night I dreamt
That somebody loved me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm

Last night I felt
Real arms around me
No hope, no harm
Just another false alarm

So tell me how long

The last one

And tell me how long
Before
The right one

But it goes on

My worried mind that you quiet
Place your hands on my face
Close my eyes and say
Love is a poor man's food
Don't prophesize
I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever
And I could hold you in my arms
I could hold you forever

This fist begets the spear
Weapons of war
Symptoms of madness

Buried myself alive on the inside, so I could shut you out
And let you go away for a long time… God!

I guess it's better you trapped yourself in your own way
And if you want me back, you're gonna have to ask

That I had my own time
I took advantage of myself and felt fine
But it was worth the night I caught an early flight
And I made it home

You learn my secrets and figure out why I'm guarded

As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye

Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

Read the lines in the mirror through the lipstick trace

She said, ""It seems you're somewhere far away,"" to his face

With the efficiency that only youth can harness

Or do you take it all more seriously?
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make-believe

Or have somebody's goodnight kisses got that covered?

I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about

And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute, it gets easy
To pretend that you were just some lover

Singing dreadful songs about summer

Pretending you were just some lover?

I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you're hurt too but
What else can we do
Tormented and torn apart
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For the times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know
Doesn't really know

[Chorus]
I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you?
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong

[Verse 2]
I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you, are you feeling it too
Does the feeling seem oh so right
And what would you say if I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way, it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone, I'll be gone...

I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And your momma's waiting up and you're thinking he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

But I'll be back, don't try and follow me
'Cause I'll return as soon as possible
See, I'm trying to find my place
But it might not be here where I feel safe
We all learn to make mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And run from them, from them
With no direction
We'll run from them, from them
With no conviction

'Cause I'm just one of those ghosts
Traveling endlessly
Don't need no roads
In fact, they follow me
And we just go in circles

[Verse 2]
Well, now I'm told that this is life
And pain is just a simple compromise
So we can get what we want out of it
Would someone care to classify
Our broken hearts and twisted minds
So I can find someone to rely on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And run to them, to them
Full speed ahead
Oh, you are not useless
We are just

Traveling endlessly
The ones we trusted the most
Pushed us far away
And there's no one road
And we should not be the same
But I'm just a ghost
And still they echo me
They echo me in circles"

But still I'll hide from you
Hide what's inside from you

When you say your heart still sings
When you're with me
Oh, won't you please forgive me?

Oh, no, no, no, no, no

And though the memories of the pubs
And the clubs and the drugs and the tubs
We shared together
Will stay with me forever

They left me dizzy
Oh, won't you please forgive me

The strange fate in my mind is all too clear


Music when the lights come on
The girl I thought I knew has gone
And with her my heart had disappeared
Well I no longer hear the music
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

All the memories of the fights and the nights
And the blue lights, all the kites
We flew together
I thought they'd fly forever

But all the highs and the lows
And the to's and the fro's
They left me dizzy
Oh, won't you forgive me

I never thought that you could break me apart
I keep a sinister smile and a hole in my heart
You want to get inside, then you can get in line
But not this time

[Chorus]
'Cause you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine

[Verse 2]
I won't try to philosophize
I'll just take a deep breath then I'll look in your eyes
This is how I feel, and it's so surreal
I got a closet filled up to the brim
With the ghosts of my past and their skeletons
And I don't know why
You'd even try
But I won't lie

[Chorus]
You caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine
Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?

[Verse 3]
And I feel a weakness coming on
It never felt so good to be so wrong
Had my heart on lockdown
And then you turned me around
And I'm feeling like a newborn child
Every time I get a chance to see you smile
It's not complicated
I was so jaded

[Pre-Chorus]
And you caught me off guard
Now I'm running and screaming

[Chorus]
I feel like a hero and you are my heroine
Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?
(I feel like a hero and you are my heroine)

[Bridge]
And I feel a weakness coming on
It never felt so good to be so wrong
Had my heart on lockdown
And then you turned me around
(Do you know that your love is the sweetest sin?)
And I'm feeling like a newborn child
Every time I get a chance to see you smile
It's not complicated
I was so jaded

And I feel a weakness coming on
It never felt so good to be so wrong

There's so much craziness surrounding me
So much going on, it gets hard to breathe
When all my faith has gone, you bring it back to me
You make it real for me

When I'm not sure of my priorities
When I've lost sight of where I'm meant to be
Like holy water washing over me
You make it real for me

[Chorus]
And I'm running to you baby
You are the only one who saves me
That's why I've been missing lately
Cause you make it real for me

When my head is strong but my heart is weak
I'm full of arrogance and uncertainty
When I can't find the words
You teach my heart to speak
You make it real for me, yeah

And I'm running to you baby
Cause you are the only one who saves me
That's why I've been missing lately
Cause you make it real for me

[Hook]
Everybody's talking in words I don't understand
You've got to be the only one who knows just who I am
You're shining in the distance, I hope I can make it through
Cause the only place I want to be
Is right back home with you

[Verse 3]
I guess there's so much more I have to learn
But if you're here with me, I know which way to turn
You always give me somewhere, somewhere I can run
You make it real for me

And I'm running to you baby
Cause you are the only one who saves me
That's why I've been missing lately

I'm fucking gone right now
I'm fucking gone right now
""Listen, listen""

From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid

[Chorus]
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work

Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night (zombies of the night)
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women

All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work

Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw ain't no nigga with her rollin
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive (The money is the motive)
All that money
The money she be folding (The money she be folding)
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work
Girl put in work, girl, girl put in work

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

I think that staying up is exactly what I need
Well take apart your head
Take apart the counting
And the flock it has bred
Goodbye to love

Right against the wall (Does everybody really need to know everyone?)
Take apart your head
Do you really think you’re really a part of it?
Right against the wall
And is your army really one of some thousands?
Chew it up and swallow it
And will you declare war on the loony bin?

Now some Saint got the job
Of writing down my sins

And broke my spleen
And broke my knee

Who said I'd lied? - Because I never

672,673,Love Is No Big Truth,Kings of Convenience,Riot on an Empty Street,,"All I do is sleep all day, and think of you
A memory of the cushion life I'm clinging to
The image of a mutual one, our haven
The sombre chords of our song, the fading

Love is no big truth
Driven by our genes, we are simple selfish beings
A symphony that's you
Joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping

Passion and its brother hate, they come and go
It could easily be made to stay for longer though
Many people play this game so willingly
Do I have to be like them, or be lonely?

Love is no big truth
Driven by our genes, we are simple selfish beings
A symphony that's you
Joyously awaking the ignorant and sleeping

Another view
Of what there is to it
Getting me through it

I'll never need it again, not again, not again (8x)"

All about me and my hobbies

So fragile, so refined

I wonder how you decorate your room
I wonder how you touch yourself and curse myself for being across the sea

Touches my foolish heart

""How could you let us down?""
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way 'round
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
One by one every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
Will I be in too deep?
Going with what I always longed for

Feel like a brand new person
(But you'll make the same old mistakes)

Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for

You can come along with me

But baby, now there's nothing left that I can do

Another version of myself
I think I've found at last
And I can't always hide away
Curse indulgence and despise the fame
There is a world out there

He let me take him in my hands
His little heart, it beats so fast
And I'm ashamed of running away

Among your hounds of love
I feel your arms surrounding me

And never know what's good for me

Stone love - she kneels before the grave
A brave son - who gave his life
To save the slogan
That hovers between the headstone and her eyes
For they penetrate her grieving
New love - a boy and girl are talking
New words - that only they can share in
New words - a love so strong it tears their hearts
To sleep - through the fleeting hours of morning

Love is careless in its choosing
Sweeping over cross a baby
Love descends on those defenseless
Idiot love will spark the fusion
Inspirations have I none
Just to touch the flaming dove
All I have is my love of love
And love is not loving

Soul love - the priest that tastes the word and
Told of love - and how my God on high is
All love - though reaching up my loneliness
Evolves, by the blindness that surrounds him

And we would too

Found your bottle, found your heart
Gives a feeling from your bottled little part [x2]

Crushed all I can then I touched your hand
Crush high
Don't want it to stop

When it was always about to hit me

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
I wonder how's it going to be
When it goes down
How's it going to be
When you're not around
How's it going to be
When you found out there was nothing
Between you and me
Cause I don't care
How's it going to be
How's it going to be

[Bridge: Stephan Jenkins]
And how's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore
And how's it going to be
Want to get myself back in again
The soft dive of oblivion
I want to taste the salt of your skin
The soft dive of oblivion (Oblivion)

[Outro: Stephan Jenkins]
How's it going to be
When you don't know me anymore
How's it going to be?
How's it going to be?"

Think about it, there must be higher love
Down in the heart and in the stars above
Without it, life is wasted time
Look inside your heart, I'll look inside mine

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what's fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

[Hook]
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love, I've been thinking of?

[Verse 2]
Worlds are turning and we're just hanging on
Facing our fear, standing out there alone
Oh a yearning, and it's real for me
There must be someone who's feeling for me

Things look so bad everywhere
In this whole world, what's fair?
We walk blind and we try to see
Falling behind in what could be

Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love
Where's this higher love, I've been thinking of?

[Verse 3]
I will wait for it, I'm not too late for it
Until then, I'll sing my song
To cheer the night along
I could light the night up with my soul on fire
I could make the sun shine from pure desire
Let me feel the love come over me
Let me feel how strong it can be

[Hook 2]
Bring me a higher love
Bring me a higher love, oh
Bring me a higher love
I could rise above for this higher love"

They were playing their salsa in the rain
With open doors and manual locks
In fast food parking lots

Oh I need somebody, I needed someone I could trust
And I don’t gamble, but if I did
I would bet on us

They took the rest when you took a nap

You just felt it was time
And I’m glad, cause you with cats

You look so defeated, lying there in your new twin sized bed
With a single pillow underneath your single head
I guess you decided that that old queen
Was more space than you would need
Now it's in the alley behind your apartment
With a sign that says ""It's free""

But I hope you have more luck with this than me

You used to think that someone would come along
And lay beside you in a space that they belong
But the other side of the mattress and box springs stayed like new
What's the point of holding onto what never gets used?

Used to barbeque up burgers and ribs
Used to have a little party every Halloween
With candy by the pile, but now

With anything to keep the thought of you from my mind
I'm doing fine, and I’m planning to keep it that way

For why you're not around, and feeling so useless

Cupid hath pulled back his sweetheart's bow
To cast divine arrows into her soul
To grab her attention swift and quick
Or morrow the marrow of her bones be thick
With turpentine kisses and mistaken blows

[Verse 2]

See the Devil may do as the Devil may care
He loves none sweeter as sweeter the dare
Her mouth the mischief he doth seek
Her heart the captive of which he speaks
So note all ye lovers in love with the sound
Your world be shattered with nary a note
Of one Cupid's arrow under your coat

[Outro]

And in the land of star crossed lovers
And barren hearted wanderers
Forever lost in forsaken missives and Satan's pull
We seek the unseekable and we speak the unspeakable
Our hopes dead gathering dust to dust
In faith, in compassion, and in love"

The metal vibrates underneath your fingers
And when you crochet
I feel mesmerized and proud

And I would say I love you

[Verse 1]
Now even though I try to play it off
I'm thinkin' 'bout you all day long
And I can't wait for shorty to come through
From your lips and back up to your eyes
My hands on your hips when we grind
I'm fantasizin' 'bout what I'm gon' do to you
Got me fiendin' for her love, can't lie
Man, you should see how she got me
Spendin' all this time with her
And I couldn't leave her if I wanted to
Her love turns men into fools
Tell me what a man is to do

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't breathe when you talk to me
I can't breathe when you're touchin' me

And my fingers all in your hair
I wonder if you feel me watchin' you

Every time it rings, I hope it's you, girl
Got me bracin' for your love
And I've fallen for you, I can't lie
I just wanna be with you
And, yes, she got me there, I said it
Somebody call the paramedics
Tell 'em to hurry up and come through

744,745,If She Wants Me,Belle and Sebastian,Dear Catastrophe Waitress,10/6/2003,"I wrote a letter on a nothing day
I asked somebody 'Could you send my letter away'?
'You are too young to put all of your hopes in just one envelope'
I said goodbye to someone that I love
It's not just me, I tell you it's the both of us
And it was hard
Like coming off the pills that you take to stay happy

Someone above has seen me do alright
Someone above is looking with a tender eye
Upon your face, you may think you're alone but you may think again

[Chorus]
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang about and be there with my best friend
If she wants me

And far away somebody read the letter
He condescends to read the words I wrote about him
And if he smiles, it's no more than a genius deserves
For all your curious nerve and your passion

I'm going deaf, you're growing melancholy
Things fall apart, I don't know why we bother at all
But life is good and 'It's always worth living at least for a while'

[Chorus]
If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there with my best friend
If she wants me

If you think to yourself 'What should I do now'?
Then take the baton, girl, you better run with it
'Cause there is no point in standing in the past cause it's over and done

I took a book and went into the forest
I climbed the hill, I wanted to look down on you
But all I saw was twenty miles of wilderness so I went home

If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there with my best friend
If she wants me

If I could do just one near perfect thing I'd be happy
They'd write it on my grave, or when they scattered my ashes
On second thoughts I'd rather hang around and be there with my best friend

The train is getting way too loud
I gotta leave here my girl
Get on with my lonely life

Just leave the ring on the rail
For the wheels to nullify

Until this turn in my head
I let you stay and you paid no rent
I spent twelve long months on the lam

That's enough sitting on the fence
For the fear of breaking dams

I find a fatal flaw
In the logic of love
And go out of my head

You love a sinking stone
That'll never elope
So get used to the lonesome
Girl, you must atone some
Don't leave me no phone number there

It took me all of a year
To put the poison pill to your ear
But now I stand on honest ground, on honest ground

You want to fight for this love
But honey you cannot wrestle a dove
So baby it's clear

You want to jump and dance
But you sat on your hands
And lost your only chance

Go back to your hometown
Get your feet on the ground
And stop floating around

I find a fatal flaw
In the logic of love
And go out of my head

You love a sinking stone
That'll never elope
So get used to used to the lonesome

About a week since the day that you walked

It was Dublin city on a Friday night
With vodkas and coke, I was Guinness all night

We were sitting with our backs against the world
Saying things that we thought but never heard

Before too late, before too long

Best friends, yeah, talking till the daylight
We took the joys alongside the pain
With not much to lose but so much to gain

Set you adrift on a memory bliss
It was Grafton Street on a rainy night
I was down on one knee and you were mine for life

Why you gotta be so mean?"

Yes I do, I believe
That one day I will be where I was
Right there, right next to you
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark
The moon, the stars are nothing without you
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?
No words can explain the way I'm missing you
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside
These tears, they tell their own story

[Pre-Chorus]
Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

[Verse 2]
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
You told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

[Chorus]
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?
And make sure you're all right
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?"

I don't know but I think I may be fallin' for you
Dropping so quickly
Maybe I should keep this to myself
Wait until I know you better

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm trying, not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say
And so I'm hiding what I'm feeling
But I'm tired of holding this inside my head

[Chorus]
I've been spending all my time
Just thinking 'bout you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I've been waiting all my life
And now I found you
I don't know what to do
I think I'm fallin' for you
I'm fallin' for you

As I'm standing here
And you hold my hand
Pull me towards you
And we start to dance
All around us
I see nobody
Here in silence
It's just you and me

I'm trying, not to tell you
But I want to
I'm scared of what you'll say

774,775,2 Atoms In A Molecule,Noah and the Whale,"Peaceful, The World Lays Me Down",8/11/2008,"Last night I had a dream we were inseparably entwined
Like a piece of rope made out of two pieces of vine
Held together, holding each other with no one else in mind
Like 2 atoms in a molecule inseparably combined

But then I woke from the dream to realise I was alone
A tragic event I must admit but let's not be overblown
I'm not trying to write a love song just a sad, pathetic moan
Maybe I just need a change, maybe I just need a new cologne

Now I look at love like being stabbed in the heart
You torture each other from day to day and then one day you part
Most of the time it's misery but there's some joy at the start
Oh for that I'd say it's worth it, just use a blade that's short and sharp on me

And if love is just a game then how come it's no fun
If love is just a game how come I've never won
I guess maybe it's possible I might be playing it wrong
And that's why every time I roll the dice I always come undone"
775,776,I Hope That I Don't Fall in Love With You,Tom Waits,Closing Time,3/6/1973,"[Verse 1]
Well, I hope that I don't fall in love with you
'Cause falling in love just makes me blue
Well, the music plays and you display your heart for me to see
I had a beer and now I hear you callin' out for me
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

[Verse 2]
Well, the room is crowded—people everywhere
And I wonder, should I offer you a chair?
Well, if you sit down with this old clown, I'll take that frown and break it
Before the evening's gone away, I think that we can make it
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

[Verse 3]
Well, the night does funny things inside a man
These old tomcat feelings you don't understand
Well, I turn around to look at you, you light a cigarette
I wish I had the guts to bum one, but we've never met
And I hope that I don't fall in love with you

[Verse 4]
I can see that you are lonesome just like me
And it being late, you'd like some company
Well, I turn around to look at you, and you look back at me
The guy you're with, he's up and split—the chair next to you is free
And I hope that you don't fall in love with me

[Verse 5]
Now, it's closing time
The music's fading out
Last call for drinks, I'll have another stout
Well, I turn around to look at you—you're nowhere to be found
I search the place for your lost face—guess I'll have another round
And I think that I just fell in love with you"

There are twenty years to go
And twenty ways to know
Who will wear
Who will wear the hat

There are twenty years to go
The best of all I hope
Enjoy the ride
The medicine show

[Chorus]
And thems the breaks for we designer fakes
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye

[Second Verse]
There are twenty years to go
The faithful and the low
The best of starts, the broken heart
The stone

There are twenty years to go
The punch-drunk and the blow
The worst of starts, the mercy part
The phone

[Chorus]
And thems the breaks for we designer fakes
We need to concentrate on more than meets the eye
And thems the breaks for we designer fakes
But it's you I take, cause you're the truth, not I

[Third Verse]
There are twenty years to go
A golden age I know
But all will pass, we'll end too fast
You know

There are twenty years to go
And many friends I hope
Though some may hold the rose, some hold the rope

And that's the end, and that's the start of it
That's the whole, and that's the part of it
That's the high, and that's the heart of it
That's the long, and that's the short of it
That's the best, and that's the test in it
That's the doubt, the doubt the trust in it
That's the sight, and that's the sound of it
That's the gift, and that's the trick in it

You're the truth, not I (X8)"

How many times must we go through this?
You've always been mine, woman, I thought you knew this
How many times must we go through this?
You'll always be mine, Cupid only misses sometimes

But we could end up broken-hearted
If we don't remember why this all started
And if they try to tell you love fades with time
Tell them there's no such thing as time
It's our time"
780,781,Love Is All,The Tallest Man on Earth,The Wild Hunt,4/12/2010,"[Verse 1]
Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
Evil's in my pocket and your will is in my hand
Oh, your will is in my hand

And I'll throw it in the current that I stand upon so still
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
Oh, mine has learned to kill

[Chorus]
Oh, I said I could rise
From the harness of our goals
Here come the tears
But like always, I let them go
Just let them go

[Verse 2]
And now spikes will keep on falling from the heavens to the floor
The future was our skin and now we don't dream anymore
No, we don't dream anymore

Like a house made from spider webs and the clouds rolling in
I bet this mighty river's both my savior and my sin
Oh, my savior and my sin

[Chorus]
Oh, I said I could rise
From the harness of our goals
Here come the tears
But like always, I let them go
Just let them go

[Verse 3]
Well I walk upon the river like it's easier than land
Evil's in my pocket and your strength is in my hand
Your strength is in my hand

And I'll throw you in the current that I stand upon so still
Love is all, from what I've heard, but my heart's learned to kill
Oh, mine has learned to kill

781,782,The Saltwater Room,Owl City,Ocean Eyes,3/17/2008,"[Verse 1]
I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light
Walking down by the bay, on the shore
Staring up at the stars that aren't there anymore
I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold
So like an introvert, I drew my over shirt
Around my arms and began to shiver violently before
You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me
Running into the dark underground
All the subways around create a great sound
To my motion fatigue, farewell, with your ear to a seashell
You can hear the waves in underwater caves
As if you actually were inside a saltwater room

[Chorus: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?
Only time, only time

[Verse 2: Adam Young]
Can you believe that the crew has gone
And they wouldn't let me sign on?
All my islands have sunk in the deep
So I can hardly relax or even oversleep
But I feel warm with your hand in mine
When we walk along the shoreline
I guess we'll never know why sparrows love the snow
We'll turn out all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow

[Interlude: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
Yeah all the time
All the time

Time together is just never quite enough
When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?

When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?
If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?
So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?
All the time, all the time

[Outro: Adam Young & Breanne Duren]
Time together is just never quite enough
When we're apart what ever are you thinking of?
What will it take to make or break this hint of love?

Than to see your face when you open the door
You'll make me beans on toast and a nice cup of tea
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV
Tomorrow we'll take the dog for a walk
And in the afternoon, then maybe we'll talk
I'll be exhausted so I'll probably sleep
And we'll get a Chinese and watch TV

You wipe the tears from my eye
And you say that all that it takes is a phone call
I cry at the thought of being alone and then
I wonder how long it'll take till I'm home again

Than to see your face when you open the door

And danced on tables
Hotels, trains and ships that sail
We swim with sharks
And fly with aeroplanes in the air

Send in the trumpets
The marching wheelchairs
Open the blankets and give them some air
Swords and arches, bones and cement
The light and the dark of the innocence of men

We know your house so very well
And we will wake you once we've walked up all of your stairs

There's nothing like living in a bottle
And nothing like ending it all for the world
We're so glad you have come back
Every living lion will lay in your lap

The kid has a homecoming! The champion, the whores!
Who's gonna play drums, guitar or organ with chorus
As far as we've walked from both of ends of sand
Never have we caught a glimpse of this man

We know your house so very well
And we will bust down your door if you're not there

And danced on tables
Hotels, trains and ships that sail
We swim with sharks
And fly with aeroplanes out of here

Out of here
Out of here

790,791,A Beautiful Mess,Jason Mraz,We Sing. We Dance. We Steal Things.,5/12/2008,"[Verse 1]
You've got the best of both worlds
You're the kind of girl who can take down a man
And lift him back up again
You are strong but you're needy
Humble but you're greedy
And based on your body language
And shoddy cursive I've been reading
Your style is quite selective
Though your mind is rather reckless
Well I guess it just suggests
That this is just what happiness is

[Chorus]
Hey, what a beautiful mess this is
It's like picking up trash in dresses

[Verse 2]
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write
Kind of turn themselves into knives
And don't mind my nerve you could call it fiction
But I like being submerged in your contradictions, dear
Cause here we are, here we are

[Verse 3]
Although you are biased I love your advice
Your comebacks ‒ they're quick
And probably have to do with your insecurities
There's no shame in being crazy
Depending on how you take these
Words i'm paraphrasing this relationship we're staging

[Chorus]
Hey, what a beautiful mess this is
It's like picking up trash in dresses

[Verse 4]
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say
Kind of turn themselves into blades
And ""kind and courteous"" is a life I've heard
But it's nice to say that we played in the dirt
Cause here, here we are, here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are
Here we are

We're still here
What a beautiful mess this is
It's like taking a guess when the only answer is ""Yes""

[Verse 5]
Through timeless words and priceless pictures
We'll fly like birds not of this earth

And tides ‒ they turn ‒ and hearts disfigure
But that's no concern when we're wounded together

[Outro]
And we tore our dresses and stained our shirts
But it's nice today. Oh, the wait was so worth it"
791,792,Walk Away,Ben Harper,Welcome To The Cruel World,2/8/1994,"Oh no, here comes that sun again
That means another day without you my friend
And it hurts me to look into the mirror at myself
And it hurts even more to have to be with somebody else

And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away

So many people to love in my life
Why do I worry about one
But you put the happy in my ness
You put the good times into my fun

And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door

We've tried the goodbyes
So many days
We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray
They say if you love somebody
Then you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery

They say that time, will make all this go away
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is a droppin on down
And once again you my friend are no where to be found

And it's so hard to do and so easy to say
But sometimes, sometimes you just have to walk away
Walk away
And head for the door
You just walk away
Walk away
Walk away
Just walk on
Walk on
Turn and head for the door
Walk away"

This is morning
That's when I spend the most time
Thinking 'bout what I've given up
This is a warning
When you start the day just to close the curtains
You're thinking 'bout what I've given up

[Chorus 1]
Where are you now?
As I'm swimming through the stereo
I'm writing you a symphony of sound
Where are you now?
As I rearrange the songs again
This mix could burn a hole in anyone
But it was you I was thinking of
It was you I was thinking of...

[Verse 2]
I read your letter
The one you left when you broke into my house
I'm retracing every step you made
And you said you meant it
And there's a piece of me in every single
Second of every single day
But if it's true then tell me how it got this way

[Chorus 1]
Where are you now?
As I'm swimming through the stereo
I'm writing you a symphony of sound

And I can't get to you
I can't get to you
I can't get to you (you, you)

Where are you now?
As I'm cutting through you track by track

But it was you I was thinking of
It was you I was thinking of...

If all our life is but a dream, fantastic posing greed
Then we should feed our jewelry to the sea

Just like broken glass to me

Comes along in storms of fabled foreign tongues
Tripping eyes and flooded lungs
Northern downpour sends its love

Hey moon, don’t you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning
Weathervanes my one and lonely

[Verse 2]
The ink is running toward the page, it’s chasing off the days
Look back at boat feet and that winding knee
I missed your skin when you were east
You clicked your heels and wished for me
Through playful lips made of yarn, that fragile Capricorn
Unraveled words like moths upon old scarves
I know the world’s a broken bone
But melt your headaches, call it home

Hey moon, please forget to fall down
Hey moon, don’t you go down
Sugarcane in the easy morning

You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

Don't even try and cheer him up because it just won't happen

'Cause she isn't there to hold your hand
She won't be waiting for you when you land

But I wanna just take this time out to be perfectly honest
‘Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold
And this load is like the weight of the world and I think my neck is breakin'
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself
But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else
But the years that I've wasted is nothin' to the tears that I've tasted
So here's what I'm facin': three felonies, six years of probation
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman
Man, I shoulda seen it comin', what'd I stick my penis up in?
Wouldn't have ripped the prenup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more
I got my baby, maybe, the only lady that I adore
Hailie! So sayonara, try tomorrow, nice to know ya
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted, and—

[Chorus 2]
Now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders
Everyone's leanin' on me
‘Cause my baby knows that her daddy's a soldier
Nothin' can take her from me

[Outro]
Wooo! Told you I can't sing
Oh, well—I tried
Hailie, 'member when I said
If you ever need anything, Daddy would be right there?
Guess what—Daddy's here
And I ain't goin' nowhere, baby
I love you (​​*smooch*)​​"

I see a love that money just can't buy
One look from you, I drift away
I pray that you are here to stay

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it

Every time I hold you, I begin to understand
Everything about you tells me I'm your man
I live my life to be with you
No one can do the things you do

Anything you want, you got it
Anything you need, you got it
Anything at all, you got it

But everything reminds me of her this evening
So if I seem a little out of it, sorry
But why should I lie? Everything reminds me of her

The spin of the earth impaled a silhouette
Of the sun on the steeple
And I gotta hear the same sermon
All the time now from you people:

'Why are you staring into outer space, crying?
Just because you came across it, and lost it...'

Everything reminds me of her
Everything reminds me of her..."

Oh but I know love as a fading thing
Just fickle as a feather in a stream
See honey, I saw love, you see it came to me
It put its face up to my face so I could see
Yeah, then I saw love disfigure me
Into something I am not recognizing

You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’
I will not open myself up this way again
I lay my face to the soil, and all my teeth to the sand
I will not lay like this for days now upon end
You will not see me fall, or see me struggle to stand
To be acknowledged by some touch from his gnarled hand
You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’
I will not open myself up this way again

You see the moon is bright in that treetop night
I see the shadows that we cast in the cold clean light
Now my feet are gold, and my heart is white
And we race out on the desert plains all night
See honey, I am not some broken thing
I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee
No my heart is gold and my feet are light
And I am racing out on the desert plains all night

Some say love is a burning thing, that it makes a fiery ring
Oh but I know love as a caging thing
Just a killer, come to call from some awful dream
Ah and all you folks, you come to see
You just stand there in the glass looking at me
But my heart is wild and my bones are steam
And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free"

Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

Oh, Elise it doesn't matter what you do
I know I'll never really get inside of you
To make your eyes catch fire
The way they should
The way the blue could pull me in
If they only would, if they only would
At least I'd lose this sense of sensing
Something else that hides away
From me and you, there are worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh, I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I'll throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round yesterday
I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do
Elise, believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke and make-believe ran out

So, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday

The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed

Hope you're listening
Forgive me if I’m young

But I’m tired of justifying
So I say to you

Stopped to take it in

And the love can begin
It might start now, yeah
Well, maybe I’m just dreaming out loud
Until then

Come home, come home
'Cause I've been waiting for you

And right now, there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
And the fight for you is all I've ever known, ever known
So come home
Ooh

Everything I can’t be
Is everything you should be
And that’s why I need you here
Everything I can’t be
Is everything you should be
And that’s why I need you here

Mother don't worry
I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bed
Mother don't worry
I've got some money I saved for the weekend
Mother, remember being so stern
With that girl who was with me?
Mother, remember the blink of an eye
When I breathed through your body?

[Chorus]
So may the sunrise bring hope
Where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds
Flying upwards over the mountain

[Verse 2]
Mother, I made it up
From the bruise of a floor of this prison
Mother, I lost it
All of the fear of the Lord I was given
Mother forget me
Now that the creek drank the cradle you sang to
Mother forgive me
I sold your car for the shoes that I gave you

[Chorus]
So may the sunrise bring hope
Where it once was forgotten
Sons could be birds
Taken broken up to the mountain

[Verse 3]
Mother, don't worry
I've got a coat and some friends on the corner
Mother, don't worry
She's got a garden we're planting together
Mother, remember the night
That the dog had her pups in the pantry?
Blood on the floor and the fleas on their paws
And you cried 'til the morning

[Chorus]
So may the sunrise bring hope
Where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds
Flying always over the mountain"

And keep my advent to your self
Because it's nothing I don't like
Is it a crisis or a boring change?
When it's central, so essential
It has a nice ring when you laugh
At the low life opinions
And they're coming to the chorus now
I keep my address to yourself cause we need secrets
We need secret cret-cret-cret-crets back right now

Because I never wanna make you feel
That you're social
Never ignorant soul
Believe in what you wanna do
And do you think that is a major flaw
When they rise up in the falling rain
And if you stay around with your knuckles ground down
The trial's over, the weapon's found
Keep my address to myself because it's secret
Cause it's secret cret-cret-cret-cret-cret-cret-cret-cret-cret-cret-cret-cret-cret back right now

So drunk in the August sun
And you're the kind of girl I like
Because you're empty and I'm empty
And you can never quarantine the past
Did you remember in December
That I won't need you when I'm gone
And if I go there, I won't stay there
Because I'm sitting here too long
I've been sitting here too long
And I've been wasted
Advocating that word for the last word
Last words come up all you've got to waste"

Lucy in the shade of the dogwood blooms
Yesterday the solace of a poison fish
Tomorrow I'll be kissing on her blood red lips

No one is the savior they would like to be
The lovesong of the buzzard in the dogwood tree
With a train of horses laughing through the traffic line
And the cradle's unimaginative sense of time

Springtime and the promise of an open fist
A tattoo of a flower on a broken wrist
Lucy tells me jokingly to wipe her brow
With a pocket map to heaven and the sun goes down"

Fragile, she doesn't see her beauty
She tries to get away
Sometimes it's just that nothing seems worth saving

Hello, tell me you know
Yeah, you figured me out
Something gave it away
It would be such a beautiful moment
To see the look on your face
To know that I know that you know now

And baby that's a case of my wishful thinking
You know nothing
Well you and I
Why, we go carrying on for hours on end
We get along much better
Than you and your boyfriend

[Chorus]
Well all I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through
And all I really want from you is to feel me
As the feeling inside keeps building
And I will find a way to you if it kills me
If it kills me

[Verse 3]
How long, can I go on like this
Wishing to kiss you
Before I rightly explode?
This double life I lead isn't healthy for me
In fact it makes me nervous
If I get caught I could be risking it all

Cause maybe there's a lot that I miss
In case I'm wrong

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
If I should be so bold
I'd ask you to hold my heart in your hand
I'd tell you from the start how I've longed to be your man
But I never said a word
I guess I'm gonna miss my chance again

All I really wanna do is love you
A kind much closer than friends use
But I still can't say it after all we've been through

If it kills me
If it kills me
I think it might kill me

Makes you lie awake all through the night
That's why

She's intoxicated by herself
Everyday she's seen with someone else
And every night she kisses someone new
Never you

You're waiting in the shadows for a chance
Because you believe at heart that if you can
Show to her what love is all about
She'll change

She'll talk to you with no one else around
But only if you're able to entertain her
The moment conversation stops she's gone
Again

She gonna be the heart that if you can
She Show the heart if you can

Says something like, ""You and me, babe, how about it?""

Anyway what you going to do about it?

And I bet and you exploded in my heart
And I forget, I forget the movie song
When you going to realize, it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?

Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame
Both dirty, both mean, yes and the dream was just the same
And I dream your dream for you and now your dream is real
How can you look at me, as if I was just another one of your deals?

[Verse 3]
Well, you can fall for chains of silver, you can fall for chains of gold
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold
You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin
Now you just say, ""Oh, Romeo, yeah, you know
I used to have a scene with him""

I said ""I love you like the stars above, I love you till I die""

And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be
I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you
Can't do anything except be in love with you

And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be
All I do is keep the beat, the bad company
And all I do is kiss you, through the bars of a rhyme

And forget where the heart is, someday

Maybe some day I will see you again
And you'll look me in my eyes and call me your friend

The world feels like it's caved in proper, sorry frown

I can change and I can grow, or we could adjust
The wicked thing about us is we always have trust
We can even have an open relationship if you must

But her eyes glaze over like she's looking straight through me
Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity
When they open up, she's looking down at her feet

There's things I can't imagine doing, things I can't imagine seeing
It weren't suppose to be easy, surely

Pull my head level with hers, so she might engage and
Look into her eyes to make her listen again
I'm not gonna fucking just fucking leave it all now
'Cause you said it'd be forever and that was your vow
And you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall down?
You're well out of order now, this is well out of town
She pulls away my arms that tightly clamp around her waist
Gently pushes me back as she looks at me straight
Turns around so she's now got her back to my face
Takes one step forward, looks back, and then walks away

All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red

[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
His love was like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street"
878,879,Bowl of Oranges,Bright Eyes,"Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground",8/13/2002,"The rain, it started tapping on the window near my bed
There was a loophole in my dreaming so I got out of it
And to my surprise my eyes were wide and already open
Just my nightstand and my dresser where those nightmares had just been
So I dressed myself and left then, out into the gray streets
But everything seemed different and completely new to me
The sky, the trees, houses, buildings, even my own body
And each person I encountered, I couldn't wait to meet
And I came upon a doctor who appeared in quite poor health
I said, ""There's nothing I can do for you you can't do for yourself""
He said, ""Oh yes you can, just hold my hand, I think that that would help""
So I sat with him a while, then I asked him how he felt

He said, ""I think I'm cured
In fact, I'm sure of it
Thank you, stranger
For your therapeutic smile""

So that's how I learned the lesson that everyone's alone
And your eyes must do some raining if you're ever going to grow
But when crying don't help, you can't compose yourself
It's best to compose a poem
An honest verse of longing or a simple song of hope
That is why I'm singing, baby don't worry, cause now I got your back
And every time you feel like crying I'm gonna try and make you laugh
And if I can't, if it just hurts too bad, then we'll wait for it to pass
And I will keep you company through those days so long and black
And we'll keep working on the problem we know we'll never solve
Of love's uneven remainders, our lives are fractions of a whole
But if the world could remain within a frame like a painting on a wall
Then I think we'd see the beauty, then we'd stand staring in awe

At our still lives posed
Like a bowl of oranges
Like a story told
By the fault lines and the soil"

My forever a home

It comes from a place that's far away
And when I'm done I feel like talking
Without you here there is less to say

Don't want you thinking I'm unhappy
What is closer to the truth
Is that if I lived 'till I was a hundred and two
I just don't think I'll ever get over you

I'm no longer moved to drink strong whiskey
I shook the hand of time and I knew
That if I lived 'till I could no longer climb my stairs
I just don't think I'll ever get over you

Your face it dances and it haunts me
Your laughter is still ringing in my ears
I still find pieces of your presence here
Even after all these years

I don't want you thinking that I don't get asked to dinner
Cause I'm here to say that I sometimes do
And even though I may seem to feel a touch of love
I just don't think I'll ever get over you

I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long
Oh, I feel like no one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

[Chorus 1]
Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover
And the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster
'Cause you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you every time

[Verse 2]
I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
Ooh, how would it be if you were standing in my shoes?
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose?
No, there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose
Oh yes

[Chorus 2]
Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you every time

[Chorus 3]
Yes, too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you

I get angry with athletic ease
Break common laws in twos and threes
If I die clutching your photograph
Don't call me boring, it's just cause I like you

Oh, take me on back, take me on back, and take me back
To the place where I could feel your heart
Is this the end or just the start
Of something really, really beautiful
Wrapped up and disguised as
Something really really ugly?

Won't you...

Come by and see me, I'm a love-letter away
I'd break your name before I'd say:
""I really love you, love you,""
No, I don't care if you saw
I watched every inch of film flash across your Roman features
And I loved it, loved it

No, I don't care if...

You think I'm eager to shut your eyes
Well, I'm sorry everybody knows
You can't break me with your gutter prose
Would you believe it? She sent me a letter
The ring, it nearly weighs her down
She's got another boy, oh boy

Steady your ears, steady your ears and read my lips
Poetry is not a luxury, it's how I break this home
And when I'm really ill, won't you cradle me?
Man is not a noble animal, but maybe woman is

Remember, I heard you...

Inside your room you said:
You'd never really live until your back's against the wall
Oh did you really mean it?
No, I never break my gaze, if just to see the scar
Remain reflected in your eyes
I think it's time to go home

Oh, tell me your thoughts
Tell me your thoughts on liberty
See there's a place where I sink to sleeping
She said:
""Oh, my vote is as red as my blood,""
Will you join me for another round?
I haven't had the chance to speak yet

Godspeed...

I break the law once every week to feel your touch
Oh, what's a book to you in bed?
Do you feel better? Older?
Say this just makes me ill
Your name is dripping from my pen
Still, you're not around to curse
I've gotta drop the gun now
Say I'm still under you

Marianne, let the ghosts sleep
Just shut your eyes and burn the past
Marianne, let the ghosts sleep tonight

In the morning, waking up to terrible sunlight
All diffuse like skin abused, the sun is half its size
When you talk you hardly even look in my eyes
In the morning, in the morning
In the doorway, holding every letter that I wrote
In the driveway, pulling away, putting on your coat
In the ocean, washing off my name from your throat
In the morning, in the morning
In the ocean, washing off my name from your throat
In the morning, in the morning

[Outro]
Green apples hang from my tree
They belong only to me
Green apples hang from my green apple tree
They belong only to, only to me
And if I just stay a while here staring at the sea
And the waves break ever closer, ever near to me
I will lay down in the sand and let the ocean lead
Carry me to Innisfree like pollen on the breeze

And took roofies with your spouse

And convicts with perfect diction
Underdogs with good intentions
Amputees with stamp collections
Plywood skinboards ride the ocean
Salty noses suntan lotion
Always seriously joking
And rambunctiously soft-spoken
I like boys that like their mothers
And I have a thing for brothers
But they always wait til we're under the covers
To say I'm sure glad we're not lovers

You're so nice and you're so smart
You're such a good friend I have to break your heart

Way that I feel

There'll be no end

I see your face before me
As I lay on my bed
I kinda get to thinking
Of all the things you said, oh yes I did
You gave your promise to me and I
Gave mine to you
I need someone beside me
In everything I do

You know I love you, I always will
My mind's made up by the
Way that I feel
There's no beginning
There'll be no end

Got to keep it moving

Is this the way a toy feels when its batteries run dry?
I am the watch you always wear, but you forget to wind

Nobody plans to be half a world away at times like these
So I sat alone and waited out the night
The best part of what has happened was the part I must have missed
So I'm asking you to shine it on and stick around
I'm not writing my goodbyes

[Verse 2]
I submit no excuse
If this is what I have to do
I owe you every day I wake
If I could I would shrink myself
And sink through your skin to your blood cells
And remove whatever makes you hurt but
I am too weak to be your cure

His wiry legs are crossed
And he's dangling my keys, he even fakes a toss

What being alone would make you realize
When it's over, all in love is fair

But you feel so right
And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for

Who knows how much further we'll go on
Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself, ""hold on to your heart""
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far
And it's more than I hoped for

I have been a fool for lesser things

Once my lover, now my friend
What a cruel thing to pretend
What a cunning way to condescend
Once my lover, and now my friend

Oh, you creep up like the clouds
And you set my soul at ease
Then you let your love abound
And you bring me to my knees

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's evil babe
The way you let your grace enrapture me
When well you know I'd be insane
To ever let that dirty game recapture me

You made me a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
I've been swinging around me
Cause I don't know when you're gonna make your move

[Verse 2]
Oh, your gaze is dangerous
And you fill your space so sweet
If I let you get too close
You'll set your spell on me

So darlin' I just wanna say
Just in case I don't come through
I was onto every play
I just wanted you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh it's so evil, my love
The way you've no reverence to my concern
So I'll be sure to stay wary of you, love
To save the pain of once my flame and twice my burn....

So I'm a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
And I've been swinging around at nothing
I don't know when you're gonna make your move

That the inevitable end was near
Made our choice, a trial by fire
To battle is the only way we feel... alive

The quickest tongue to divide and devour
Divide and devour

If I could end the quest for fire
For truth, for love, for my desire
My desire

For underground metaphors
You can scrape an inch below the turf, for what it's worth
My style's been developed in the core of the Earth
The exhale's volcanic, the inhale is seismic
So brothers just panic when the Live one arrives with
The natural ability to run through your crew
From 2-1-4 to 2-1-3 to 2-1-2
In other words, from Dallas, to L.A., to the place where J stay
Everyday is mayday
So you can talk your shit on how you're wettin MC's
With mad blood stains but I'll bet you can't stand the rain
I'm lookin' on your brain with disdain
Go back and reflect on my endeavors black I can't complain
It's like a raw deal, consistant with the way I make you feel
The ends stay revealed but the means I conceal
And those who try to steal get decapitated
You wanna snatch my H2O type flow, but it evaporated
I displays my credentials over instrumentals
And my potential, increases at a rate that's exponential
It's detremental fuckin' with my thesis
The penetration's exact, like amniocentesis
I rip your shit to pieces after drainin out your fluid
My vocab is fluent yours is evident of being truant
I know you wanna make moves but son you best to take a second look
Before my knight takes your rook

[Hook]
Cause everybody rappin, and only few can flow
So why the hell they tryin to deal with Live I don't know
I handle true MC's on their block or at their show
So if you come with bull kid, keep it on the low

[J-Live]
Cause yo, I got the hairsplittin, self-written unbitten style
That leaves the competition running scared and shakin in their pants
You best to set it off cause black it ain't no second chance
Once I'm open, all you doin is hopin that the Live one
Will put the mic down, but son don't try to snatch it after
The laughter won't cease from the comparison, how dare you son
Step around the booth when I'm on
The microphone magician says poof, you're gone with the wind -
(Background: ""The Best Part, is brought to you by the letters: J, L, I, V, and E"")
- There's no trace of your friends cause you don't know where the
Beginning ends or where the end begins
But you see that's the difference, you get sold, I get paid
Black I told you, get played
If you're broke I'll have to rain on your parade
You belong in Special Ed if you think you got it made
J-Live with the mic is like the chef with the blade
Cause suckers get sliced and sauteed
Yeah, you thought your shit was fly but the flight was delayed
Because

[Hook: repeat 2x]

[J-Live]
Cause yo, I take the grey matter of pretenders
Through my mental blender, and then return to sender
My pen don't pretend to offend
I intend to render MC's, hangin loose like a fender bender
I recommend regardless of your gender
That you strike fuckin' with J-Live from your agenda
And remember that whoever lends a helpin hand to defend ya
Will get burned to a cinder
As I end the, reign of wack MC's with their suicidal tendencies
Renderin me sick, with the thoughts of killin enemies
But then I return to reality
Metaphorically murderin MC's when they battle me
You can't rattle me
I'm not your average snake slitherin through the grass
I surpass the serpent as I head to class
You consider me crass as I wax that ass, style's no joke
But you best belive I gets the last laugh"

That I'm sorry for the things I've done
But when I start to try to tell you
That's when you have to tell me
""Hey… this kind of trouble's only just begun""
I tell myself too many times
Why don't you ever learn to keep your big mouth shut
That's why it hurts so bad to hear the words
That keep on falling from your mouth
Falling from your mouth, falling from your mouth
Tell me…
Why?

I may be mad
I may be blind
I may be viciously unkind
But I can still read what you're thinking
And I've heard it said too many times
That you'd be better off
Besides…
Why can't you see this boat is sinking
(This boat is sinking, this boat is sinking)
Let's go down to the water's edge
And we can cast away those doubts
Some things are better left unsaid
But they still turn me inside out
Turning inside out, turning inside out

Tell me
Why?

Tell me
Why?

This is the book I never read
These are the words I never said
This is the path I'll never tread
These are the dreams I'll dream instead
This is the joy that's seldom spread
These are the tears…
The tears we shed
This is the fear
This is the dread
These are the contents of my head
And these are the years that we have spent
And this is what they represent
And this is how I feel
Do you know how I feel?
‘Cause I don't think you know how I feel, how I feel"

Make an exception"" I am not worried

Wrap her up in a package of lies
Send her off to a coconut island
I am not worried
I am not overly concerned

With the status of my emotions
Oh, she says, ""You're changing""
But we're always changing
It does not bother me to say

This isn't love
'Cause if you don't wanna talk about it
Then it isn't love
And I guess, I'm gonna have to live without

But I'm sure there's something in a shade of gray
Or something in between
And I can always change my name
If that's what you mean

My friend assures me, ""It's all or nothing""
But I am not really worried
I am not overly concerned

You try to tell yourself the things, you try tell yourself
To make yourself forget, to make yourself forget
I am not worried

""If it's love,"" She said
""Then we've gonna have to think about the consequences""
Cause she can't stop shaking
And I can't stop touching her

And this time, when kindness falls like rain
It washes her away
And Anna begins to change her mind

""These seconds when I'm shaking
Leave me shuddering for days,"" She says
And I'm not ready for this sort of thing

But I'm not gonna break
And I'm not gonna worry about it anymore
I'm not gonna bend and I'm not gonna break
Gonna worry about it anymore
No, no, no, no, no

It seems like I should say
""As long as this is love""
But it's not all that easy, so maybe I should

Snap her up in a butterfly net
And pin her down on a photograph album
I am not worried
'Cause you've done this sort of thing before

But then I start to think about the consequences
'Cause I don't get no sleep in a quiet room

And this time, when kindness falls like rain
It washes me away
And Anna begins to change my mind

Every time she sneezes, I believe it's love
And oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

She's talking in her sleep
It's keeping me awake
And Anna begins to toss and turn

And every word is nonsense, but I understand
And oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing

Her kindness bangs a gong
It's moving me along
And Anna begins to fade away

It's chasing me away, she disappears
And oh, Lord, I'm not ready for this sort of thing"

948,949,Play Crack the Sky,Brand New,Deja Entendu,6/17/2003,"[Verse 1]
We sent out the S.O.S. call
It was a quarter past four in the morning
When the storm broke our second anchor line
Four months at sea
Four months of calm seas
To be pounded in the shallows off the tip of Montauk Point

They call 'em rogues, they travel fast and alone
One hundred foot faces of God's good ocean gone wrong
What they call love is a risk
Cause you will always get hit
Out of nowhere by some wave
And end up on your own

[Chorus 1]
The hole in the hull defied the crew’s attempts
To bail us out
And flooded the engines and radio
And half-buried bow

[Verse 2]
Your tongue is a rudder
It steers the whole ship
Sends your words past your lips
Keeps them safe behind your teeth
But the wrong words will strand you
Come off course while you sleep
Sweep your boat out to sea
Or dashed to bits on the reef

The vessel groans
The ocean pressures its frame
To the port I see the lighthouse
Through the sleet and the rain
And I wish for one more day to give my
Love and repay debts
But the morning finds our bodies washed up 30 miles west

[Chorus 2]
They say that the captain stays fast with the ship
Through still and storm
But this ain't the Dakota
And the water's cold (so cold)
Won't have to fight for long

[Outro]
(This is the end)
This story's old but it goes on and on
Until we disappear
(This is the calm)
Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed
While you were underneath

(We are the risen)
I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains
Sunk below the sea
(After the storm)
I spoke the words but never gave a thought
To what they all could mean

(Rest in the deep)
I know that this is what you want
A funeral keeps both of us apart
(Washed up on the beach)
You know that you are not alone
I need you like water in my lungs

(This is the end)
This story's old but it goes on and on
Until we disappear
(This is the calm)
Calm me and let me taste the salt you breathed
While you were underneath

(We are the risen)
I am the one who haunts your dreams of mountains
Sunk below the sea
(After the storm)
I spoke the words but never gave a thought
To what they all could mean

(Rest in the deep)
I know that this is what you want
A funeral keeps both of us apart

You know that you are not alone
I need you like water in my lungs

This is the end

It's like a story of love
Can you hear me?
Came back only yesterday
Who went further away
Want you near me

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I need you

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

This is gonna take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more

Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door

All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you"

In fact, I am told that a lot
Now I know all the wrong turns
The stumbles, and falls brought me here

And where was I before the day
That I first saw your lovely face?
Now I see it everyday
And I know that I am
I am, I am the luckiest

What if I'd been born fifty years before you
In a house on the street where you live?
Maybe I'd be outside as you passed on your bike
Would I know?

And in a wide sea of eyes
I see one pair that I recognize
And I know that I am
I am, I am the luckiest

I love you more than I have
Ever found a way to say to you

Next door, there's an old man who lived to his 90's
And one day, passed away in his sleep
And his wife, she stayed for a couple of days
And passed away

I'm sorry, I know that's a strange way
To tell you that I know we belong
That I know that I am
I am, I am the luckiest"

When you hear like you're alone
The rusty gears of morning
And faceless, busy phones
We gladly run in circles
But the shape we meant to make is gone

And love is a tired symphony
You hum when you're awake
And love is a crying baby
Mama warned you not to shake
And love's the best sensation
Hiding in the lion's mane

So I'll clear the road, the gravel
And the thorn bush in your path
That burns a scented oil
That I'll drip into your bath
The water's there to warm you
And the earth is warmer
When you laugh

And love is the scene I render
When you catch me wide awake
And love is a dream you enter
Though I shake and shake and shake you
And love's the best endeavor
Waiting in the lion's mane"
953,954,Jaws Theme Swimming,Brand New,Deja Entendu,6/17/2003,"In a car outside, we stalk the idle kind
If you're leaving, just let me know
Tobacco and peppermint, dusting for fingerprints
A film in her eyes from the glow
Some rules are made with all intentions to break
And she defends it with a warped rationale
And I've seen what happens to the wicked and proud
When they decide to try to take on the throne for the crown

[Chorus]
And we learn as we age
We've learned nothing
And my body still aches
And you take cause they give
Though I love you
And my body it leaks like a sieve

When it got cold outside, smoke beneath the playground lights
If you're coming home, just let me know
Sucking on your breath mint, dissected and stuck with pins
A film in her eyes from the glow
Concrete and water, she's looking for her daughter
At midnight in torrential downpour
And everything I said about how messed up your head is
Got cut up and left in bits and pieces on the cutting room floor

[Chorus x2]
And we learn as we age
We've learned nothing and my body still aches
And you take cause they give
Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve

Take the picture from the wall when you think that nothing matters
Take the picture from the frame and it's a long ways to the floor
Cut your finger on the edge cause it's sharper than they told you
Take a leap from out the window cause it's way too far to go through the door

And we learn as we age
We've learned nothing and my body still aches
And you take cause they give
Though I love you and my body it leaks like a sieve"

Must have been three years since we last spoke

The image of your face from the memories so old
I tried so hard to follow
But didn't catch the half of what had gone wrong
Said I don't know what I can save you from
I don't know what I can save you from

I asked you to come over, and within half an hour
You were at my door
I had never really known you
But I realized that the one you were before
Had changed into somebody for whom

964,965,Sometime Around Midnight,The Airborne Toxic Event,The Airborne Toxic Event,8/5/2008,"And it starts sometime around midnight
Or at least that's when you lose yourself for a minute or two
As you stand under the bar lights
And the band plays some song
About forgetting yourself for a while
And the piano's this melancholy soundtrack to her smile
And that white dress she's wearing
You haven't seen her for a while

But you know that she's watching
She's laughing, she's turning
She's holding her tonic like a crux
The room's suddenly spinning
She walks up and asks how you are
So you can smell her perfume
You can see her lying naked in your arms

And so there's a change in your emotions
And all these memories come rushing
Like feral waves to your mind
Of the curl of your bodies like two perfect circles entwined
And you feel hopeless and homeless
And lost in the haze of the wine

Then she leaves with someone you don't know
But she makes sure you saw her
She looks right at you and bolts
As she walks out the door
Your blood boiling, your stomach in ropes
Oh, and your friends say ""What is it?
You look like you've seen a ghost""

Then you walk under the streetlights
And you're too drunk to notice that everyone's staring at you
You just don't care what you look like
The world is falling around you

You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You just have to see her
You know that she'll break you in two"

I got my maple syrup, everything but you

Wipe the spots up off the mirror

Consoled a cup of coffee but it didn't wanna talk
So I picked up the paper, it was more bad news

I saw a movie and it just wasn't the same
Cause it was happy or I was sad
And it made me miss you oh so bad 'cause...

I know you hate it when I leave the light on
I pick a book up and then I turn the sheets down

I'm half alive but I feel mostly dead
I try and tell myself it'll all be alright
I just shouldn't think anymore tonight 'cause...

I was sitting there, selling turnips on a flatbed truck
Crunching on a pork rind when she pulled up
She had to be thinking, ""This is where rednecks come from""
She had Hollywood written on her license plate
She was lost and looking for the Interstate
Needing directions, and I was the man for the job

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

[Verse 2]
I was sitting there, thinking about her pretty face
Kicking myself for not catching her name
I threw my hat, and thought, you fool, it could have been love
I knew my old Ford couldn't run her down
She probably didn't like me anyhow
So I watched her disappear into a cloud of dust

[Chorus]
I told her, way up yonder past the caution light
There's a little country store with an old Coke sign
You got to stop in and ask Miss Bell for some of her sweet tea
Then a left will take you to the Interstate
But a right will bring you right back here to me

Is this Georgia heat playing tricks on me?
Or am I really seeing what I think I see?
The woman of my dreams coming back to me

Don't know why, but something felt right
When she stopped in and asked Miss Bell
For some of her sweet tea
Mama gave her a big old glass
And sent her right back here to me

A lone doorframe in a wall
When everything’s overgrown
But what she really really wanted was my rights and my wrongs
And I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along

[Verse]
And I want you to know
I took it with me
That when things are thrown away like they are daily
Time passes and the constants stay

[Chorus]
So if that is how it is
I don’t wanna be a star
But a stone on the shore
A lone doorframe in a wall
When everything’s overgrown
But what she really really wanted was my rights and my wrongs
And I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along
And I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along
And I wouldn’t understand but I would try playing along

[Verse]
And I want you to know
I took it with me
That when things are thrown away like they are daily
Time passes and the constants stay
Time passes and the constants stay
Time passes and the constants stay
Time passes and the constants stay"
984,985,Land Locked Blues,Bright Eyes,"I’m Wide Awake, It’s Morning",1/25/2005,"If you walk away, I'll walk away
First tell me which road you will take
I don't want to risk our paths crossing some day
So you walk that way, I'll walk this way

And the future hangs over our heads
And it moves with each current event
Until it falls all around
Like a cold steady rain
Just stay in when it's looking this way

And the moon's laying low in the sky
Forcing everything metal to shine
And the sidewalk holds diamonds
Like the jewelry store case
They argue walk this way, no, walk this way

And Laura's asleep in my bed
As I'm leaving she wakes up and says
""I dreamed you were carried away on the crest of a wave
Baby don't go away, come here""

And there's kids playing guns in the street
And one's pointing his tree branch at me
So I put my hands up
I say ""Enough is enough
If you walk away, I'll walk away""
And he shot me dead

I found a liquid cure
From my landlocked blues
It'll pass away like a slow parade
It's leaving but I don't know how soon

And the world's got me dizzy again
You'd think after 22 years I'd be used to the spin
And it only feels worse when I stay in one place
So I'm always pacing around or walking away
I keep drinking the ink from my pen
And I'm balancing history books up on my head
But it all boils down to one quotable phrase:
""If you love something, give it away""

A good woman will pick you apart
A box full of suggestions for your possible heart
But you may be offended and you may be afraid
But don't walk away, don't walk away

We made love on the living room floor
With the noise in the background of a televised war
And in the deafening pleasure
I thought I heard someone say
""If we walk away, they'll walk away""

But greed is a bottomless pit
And our freedom's a joke
We're just taking a piss
And the whole world must watch the sad comic display
If you're still free start running away
Cause we're coming for you!

I've grown tired of holding this pose
I feel more like a stranger each time I come home
So I'm making a deal with the devils of fame
Saying, ""Let me walk away, please""
You'll be free, child, once you have died
From the shackles of language and measurable time
And then we can trade places, play musical graves
Till then walk away, walk away

So I'm up at dawn
Putting on my shoes
I just want to make a clean escape
I'm leaving but I don't know where to
I know I'm leaving but I don't know where to"

Real is love
Love is feeling, feeling love

Touch is love
Love is reaching, reaching love

Won't you let me meet you at the pool?
Maybe Friday I can
Get tickets for the dance
And I'll take you
Ooh-hoo

Won't you tell your dad to get off my back?
Tell him what we said about ""Paint It, Black""
Rock and roll is here to stay
Come inside, well, it's ok
And I'll shake you
Ooh-hoo

Won't you tell me what you're thinking of?
Would you be an outlaw for my love?

If it's no, then I can go

The D.A. is dressed to the nines
In the mirror, he practices all his lines
To his closing argument, twelve hearts beat in favor
I'm guessing that he read the morning paper
The headline reads ""The man hangs""
But the jury doesn't

[Pre-Chorus]
And everyone's looking for relief
United States versus disbelief
Mothers cast tears on both sides of the aisle
Clear your throat and face the world
The verdict falls like bachelors for bad luck girls
Only breathing with the aid of denial

[Chorus]
Case open, case shut
But you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head
Isn't it tragic?

[Verse 2]
He glances at his peers sitting seven to twelve stacked
On one to six, the gallery is hushed
Boys in three pieces dream of grandstanding and bravado
The city sleeps in a cell, notwithstanding what we all know
Hang on a rope or bated breath
Whichever you prefer

[Pre-Chorus]
And everyone's looking for relief
A bidding war for an old flame's grief
The cause, the kid, the course
The charm, and the curse
Not a word that could make you comprehend
Too well dressed for the witness stand
The press prays for whichever headline's worse

[Chorus]
Case open, case shut
But you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head
Isn't it tragic?

[Bridge]
Fresh pressed suit and tie
Unimpressed birds sing and die
Can talk my way out of anything
The foreman reads the verdict
""In the above entitled actions, we find the defendant...""
Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty

[Chorus]
Case open, case shut
But you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head
Isn't it tragic?

Case open, case shut
But you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head
Isn't it tragic?"

Lost again, lost again
One day I know our paths will cross again
Smile again, smile again
One day I hope to make you smile again

Many times I've been told
Speak your mind, just be bold

So I close my eyes, look behind
Moving on, moving on
So I close my eyes

All the tears will clear
Then I feel no fear
Then I'd feel no way
My paths will remain straight

Home again, home again
One day I know I'll feel home again
Born again, born again
One day I know I'll feel strong again

And I miss you
Even here taking it all in
The sand, silvered, carries the moon
On its shoulders
Is it possible to put this night to tune
And move it to you?

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you

Cargo ships move by
Tracing on the horizon line
There's a luster from the city lights
On the waves that kiss our feet
And we're thinking of going in
(Thinking of going in)
The time's getting thin

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this
If I can make this
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you

This is a city for not sleeping
And the clocks are set by feel
At this moment from where I sit
None of it seems real

Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
Don't cry, I'll bring this home to you
If I can make this night light enough to move
If I can make this
If I can make this

Back in school they never taught us what we needed to know
Like how to deal with despair, or someone breaking your heart
For twelve years I've held it all together
But a night like this is begging to pull me apart
I played it quiet, left you deep in conversation
I felt uncool and hung out around the kitchen
I remember I kept thinking that I know you never would
And now I know I want to kill you like only a best friend could

[Chorus]
Everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on to

[Verse 2]
As if this happening wasn't enough
I got to go and write a song just to
Remind myself how bad it sucked
Ignore the sun, the cover's over my head
I wrote a message on my pillow that says
""Jesse, stay asleep in bed""
So don't apologize (I hope you choke and die!)
Search your cell for something with which to hang yourself
They say you need to pray if you want to go to heaven
But they don't tell you what to say
When your whole life has gone to hell

[Chorus]
Everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on to

And everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on to
And I can't let you
Let me down again
And I can't let you
Let me down again

So, is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in 11-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
And again when your head goes through the windshield

Is that what you call tact?
You're as subtle as a brick in the small of my back
So let's end this call, and end this conversation

And is that what you call a getaway?
Well tell me what you got away with
Cause you left the frays from the ties you severed
When you say best friends means friends forever

Is that what you call a getaway?
Tell me what you got away with
'Cause I've seen more spine in jellyfish
I've seen more guts in 11-year-old kids
Have another drink and drive yourself home
I hope there's ice on all the roads
And you can think of me when you forget your seatbelt
And again when your head goes through the windshield

[Chorus]

And everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on to


And everyone's caught on to
Everything you do
Everyone's caught on to

Let me down again
And I can't let you
Let me down again

And I can't let you
Let me down again
And I can't let you

This party is old and uninviting
Participants all in black and white
You enter in full-blown technicolor
Nothing is the same after tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
If the world would fall apart in a fiction worthy wind
I wouldn't change a thing now that you're here

[Chorus]
Yeah, love is a verb here in my room
Here in my room, here in my room
Yeah, love is a verb here in my room
Here in my room, here in my room

[Verse 2]
You enter and close the door behind you
Now show me the world as seen from the stars
If only the lights would dim a little
I'm weary of eyes upon my scars

[Pre-Chorus]
If the world would fall apart in a fiction worthy wind
I wouldn't change a thing now that you're here

[Chorus]
Yeah, love is a verb here in my room
Here in my room, here in my room
Yeah, love is a verb here in my room
Here in my room, here in my room

[Verse 3]
Pink tractor beam into your incision
Head spinning as free as dervish's whirl
I came here expecting next to nothing
So, thank you for being that kind of girl
That kind of girl
That kind of girl
That kind of girl
That kind of girl
That kind of girl
That kind of girl
That kind of girl
That kind of girl

Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss
I'd broke my wrist

It all kicked off
I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind
'Cos love's hard to find

[Hook]
La la la la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence far too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

[Chorus]
Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we will meet again

[Verse 2]
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
'Cos we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true

[Hook]
La la la la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
The last stand
Let go of my hand

[Chorus]
Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we will meet again

You go your way and
I'll go my way
No words can save us
This lifestyle made us
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we can meet again"

And you know
I’m not one  (I'm not one) for complaining (for complaining)
But I love the way you’d roll
Excuses off the tip of your tongue
As I slowly fall apart (slowly, quietly, slowly)
Fall apart
Is falling apart
Is falling apart
Is falling apart

As of this won’t mean a thing come tomorrow
And that’s exactly how I’ll make it seem
Cause I'm still not sleeping
Thinking I’ve crawled home from worse than this

So please, please (please)
I’m running out of sympathy (I'm running out of sympathy!)

I never said I'd take this lying down

Then what’s the point
Then what’s the point
Then what’s the point

I'm in your room
Is this turning you on
Am I turning you on?

I'm in your room
Are you turned on?

I'm on the corner of your bed
I'm thinking maybe
Are you turned on?
Are you turned on?"
996,997,Surprise Ice,Kings of Convenience,Riot on an Empty Street,,"When past sometimes takes you with soft hands
Forceless it pulls you to your chair
Hides you away from these half days
Sunless, at the end of the year

The air is like a knife cutting through you
A room in the house is always warm
Stretched down on the bathroom floor thinking
Of fair days your future may hold

Love comes like surprise ice on the water
Love comes like surprise ice at dawn
Love comes like surprise ice on the water
Love comes at dawn

Deprived all the light of colours
The world ends at your window tree
Darkness creates these illusions
That pale days can teach you to see

Rain falls but no life is given
Weeks pass, no progress is made
Past sometimes takes you with soft hands
And all that surrounds you will fade

Love comes like surprise ice on the water
Love comes like surprise ice at dawn
Love comes like surprise ice on the water
Love comes at dawn"

Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am

But these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true
I was made for you

I climbed across the mountaintops
Swam all across the ocean blue
I crossed all the lines and I broke all the rules
But baby I broke them all for you

Oh because even when I was flat broke
You made me feel like a million bucks
You do
I was made for you

You see the smile that's on my mouth
It's hiding the words that don't come out
And all of my friends who think that I'm blessed
They don't know my head is a mess

No they don't know who I really am
And they don't know what I've been through
Like you do, and I was made for you

All of these lines across my face
Tell you the story of who I am
So many stories of where I've been
And how I got to where I am

Oh but these stories don't mean anything
When you've got no one to tell them to
It's true
I was made for you
Oh yeah, well it's true
That I was made for you"

Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one"

I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

[Hook]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

[Verse 2]
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

[Hook]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

[Verse 3]
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I’ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"

It's the last thing I hear at night
And the first thing in the morning
And as I let it start to burn my head
You slowly creep into bed
I'm done with all the talking

You say you know how I'm feeling
I just need to try to settle down

Oh a million faces pass my way
Oh they're all the same
Nothing seems to change
Anytime I look around
Oh who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you

Tired as hell and falling up the stairs
Filled with a thousand cares
As you walk out from the bedroom
Though it feels like all my fire has gone
Girl, you just turn me on
Can't believe how much I want you

You say you know how I'm feeling
I just need to try to settle down

Oh a million faces pass my way
Oh they're all the same
Nothing seems to change
Anytime I look around
Oh who knows just what the future holds
All I want to know is if it's with you

We're distracted by the hard times
And the troubles that we make
Let us throw them in the ocean
Let it wash our cares away

Oh the phone you know it never stops
It's the last thing I hear at night
And the first thing in the morning

Oh a million faces pass my way
Oh they're all the same
Nothing seems to change
Anytime I look around
Oh who knows just what the future holds

In fur and gold
Got into the wrong pair of hands
And truth was sold
They bought it for, oh, so much less
Than it was worth
And every man that touched it
Found a heaven on earth

Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms

The queens and the court jesters
Clapped, adored
Their hearts swelled to overdrive
And mercy soared
Mercy this and mercy that
Let justice prevail
But I just want my trophy back
It's not for sale

Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms

Creatures of mercy
Shoot, shoot
Shoot them down
And set me free

Creatures of mercy
Shoot, shoot
Shoot them down
And set me free

When I got my trophy back
It took some time
To polish it to gold from black
And shoot the lion
And when I put it back inside
And locked the door
A trophy of mercy
Is a trophy no more

Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms
Heaven is a feeling I get in your arms

Creatures of mercy
Shoot, shoot
Shoot them down

And the day feels broken
I tilt my head
I'm trying to get an angle
'Cause the evening
I've always longed for
It could still happen

The perfect day
Six glasses of water
Seven phone calls
If you leave it alone
It might just happen
Anyway

Oh it never really was
It's not up to you
Well it never really was

And the day feels a-broken
Just lean into the crack
(Just lean into the crack)
And it will tremble
Ever so nicely
Notice how it sparkles
Down there

I can decide
What I give
But it's not up to me
What I get given

Love, I get so lost sometimes
Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away, I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go, I come back to the place you are

[Pre-Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
All my instincts, they return
And the grand façade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside

[Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes I am complete
In your eyes I see the doorway
In your eyes to a thousand churches
In your eyes the resolution
In your eyes of all the fruitless searches
In your eyes
In your eyes Oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I wanna be that complete
In your eyes, the light, the heat
In your eyes
I wanna touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes

[Verse 2: Peter Gabriel]
Love, I don't like to see so much pain
So much wasted and this moment keeps slipping away
I get so tired of working so hard for our survival
I look to the time with you to keep me awake and alive

[Pre-Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
And all my instincts, they return
And the grand façade, so soon will burn
Without a noise, without my pride
I reach out from the inside

[Chorus: Peter Gabriel]
In your eyes your eyes, your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes the light, the heat
In your eyes I am complete
In your eyes I see the doorway
To a thousand churches
In your eyes the resolution
In your eyes of all the fruitless searches
Oh, I see the light and the heat
In your eyes
Oh, I wanna be that complete
In your eyes
I want to touch the light, the heat I see in your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes
In your eyes

Breathe your smoke into my lungs
In the back of the car with you I stare into the sun
Still not too old to die young
But lovers hold on to everything
And lovers hold on to anything

I need you more than I can take
You promise forever and a day
And then you take it all away

Place a kiss on my cheekbone
Then you vanish me, I'm buried in the snow
But something tells me I'm not alone
But lovers hold on to everything

Oh, fight me""

Oh, a candle at my chest, and a head on his knee
I got up; it was dark; there's no one in the park at this hour
How do I keep finding myself here?
""Oh, fight me""

If I look back and he is screaming
I'd left him dreaming; a dangerous feat
And I'll run back and shake him tightly
And scream, ""If they want him, oh, they're gonna have to fight me

So I asked out of respect, uh
Would she like to explore the world of I, we can fly in my jet
Her reply was yes (Can I ask you something?)
I seen it in her eye, mama looking like all I wanted was sex
Then moved to the next (That ain't true)
But it was something about this girl's style that make me feel no regrets
We started off casual, walks through the park (Park)
Candle light dinners by dark (Dark), I'm thinking smart (Smart)
Afraid she might think I'm in a rush to touch, crush and be up
But baby I ain't on that stuff
Dropped her off and told her call me up (brrring)

Ever mess wit' it? Please don't
Told her I'm goin' home, she asked can she go too

Then break my dreams the way you do?
How can I have got in so deep?
Why did I fall in love with you?

This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been
Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen
This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known
I was never crazy on my own
And now I know that there's a link between the two
Being close to craziness and being close to you

How can you make me fall apart
Then break my fall with loving lies?
It's so easy to break a heart
It's so easy to close your eyes
How can you treat me like a child
Yet like a child I yearn for you?
How can anyone feel so wild?
How can anyone feel so blue?

Constant quarreling, the childish fits
And our clothes in a pile on the ottoman
All the slander and double-speak
Were only foolish attempts to show you did not mean
Anything but the blatant proof
Was your lips touching mine in the photobooth

And as the summer's ending
The cool air will push your hard heart away
You were so condescending
And this is all that's left
Scraping paper to document
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on

Cup your mouth to compress the sound
Skinny dipping with the kids from a nearby town
And everything that I said was true
As the flashes blinded us in the photobooth
Well, I lost track, and then those words were said
You took the wheel and you steered us into my bed
And soon we woke and I walked you home
And it was pretty clear that it was hardly love

And as the summer's ending
The cool air will rush your hard heart away
You were so condescending
And this is all that's left
Scraping paper to document
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on

And as the summer's ending
The cool air will rush your hard heart away
You were so condescending
As the alcohol drained the days

And as the summer’s ending

So pack a change of clothes cause it’s time to move on"

1026,27,Unsolved Mysteries,Animal Collective,Strawberry Jam,9/10/2007,"""Oh look at me"", that sweet boy's plea
His mother cried, ""My child's tied his laces""
Why must we move on from such happy lawns
Into nostalgia's palm and feed on the traces

Do you hop to the dance or embarrass the parents?
Who should I please? I go to sleep worrying
That blood in the dark will attract the sharks
Who are not violent we all got hungry bellies

But where are the still unborn who could look at me with the one eye
Who could look at me with no eyes
Who could look at me with me in their eyes

What's pain? What's sadness anyway? It's not crying like a child

What's graying? What's aging anyway? It's not growing in the wild

I feel like I've just been born
When you look at me with your green eyes
When you look at me with your black eyes
When you look at me with your dead eyes

And I can't understand when holding her hand
So womanly, I have to go and kiss her

And what a surprise to look in those eyes
To find suddenly he is Jack, the Ripper
Too suddenly he was Jack, the Ripper

He stopped crying like a child
She stopped crying like a child
Jack, the Ripper [x3]"

How the boy feels?

Flick your cigarette, then kiss me
Flick your eyes at mine so briefly
Your leather jacket lies in sticky pools of cider, blackberry
You glance a ricochet from every alpha male behind me
Eyes like marbles on a washing machine
Oh and do you ever wonder
How the boy feels?

Katherine, kiss me

Tonight, I don’t mind
Because I never wonder

Nowadays it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some

Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes I'm 'bout to take the hint from

Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?

And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine

1042,43,Me vs. Maradona vs. Elvis,Brand New,Deja Entendu,6/17/2013,"With one or two, I get used to the room
We go slow when we first make our moves
By five or six, bring you out to the car
Number nine with my head on the bar
And it's sad but true, out of cash and IOUs

I got desperate desires and unadmirable plans
My tongue will taste of gin and malicious intent
Bring you back to the bar, get you out of the cold
My sober straight face gets you out of your clothes
And they're scared that we know all the crimes they'll commit
Who they'll kiss before they get home

[Chorus]
I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say

Barely conscious in the door where you stand
Your eyes are fighting sleep while your mouth makes your demands
You laugh at every word, trying hard to be cute
I almost feel sorry for what I'm gonna do
And your hair smells of smoke
Who will cast the first stone?
You can sin or spend the night all alone

Brass buttons on your coat hold the cold
In the shape of a heart that they cut out of stone
You're using all your looks that you've thrown from the start
If you let me have my way, I swear, I'll tear you apart

Cause it's all you can be
You're a drunk, and you're scared
It's ladies night, all the girls drink for free

[Chorus]
I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say
I will lie awake and lie for fun
And fake the way I hold you
Let you fall for every empty word I say"

When I had you there but then I let you go

So I drove around till I saw the neon light
A corner bar, and it just seemed right
So I pulled up

Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: ""What'll it be?""
I said: ""The good stuff""

He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said: ""You can't find that here

Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

[Verse 6]
He said ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

[Chorus 2]
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'

Insect noise is all that I hear
A magic trick makes the world disappear
The skies are dark, they're dark but they're clear

A distant motorcade and suddenly there's joy
The snow and tickertape blurs all my senses numb
It's like the finish line where everything just ends
The crack of radios seems close enough to touch

Cold water, cleaning my wounds
A side parade, with a single balloon
I'm done with this, I'm counting to ten
Blue as seas, running to them

I feel like I am watching everything from space
And in a minute I hear my name and I wake
I think the finish line's a good place we could start
Take a deep breath, take in all that you could want"

Drawing deep breaths past my door
And last night's phrases
Sick with lack of basis
Are still writhing on my floor

That your wicked words should work in holding me down
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information
Given at close range
For the gag and the bind
And the ammunition round

Became dialogue
As a diagram of a play for blood
- Took a vacation; my palate got clean
Now I can taste your agenda
While you're spitting your cud

I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown

When I was sitting up straight
Changed the name of the game cause he lost it
He knew he was wrong
But he knew it too late
But I'm not being fair
Cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth
But I'd like to choose right
Take all the things
That I said
That he stole
Put 'em in a sack
Swing 'em over my shoulder
Turn on my heels, step out of his sight
Try to live in a lovelier light

Two by two their bodies become one

Can't you feel the weight of my stare
You're so close but still a world away
What I'm dying to say, is that

I never wanted anyone like this

And it didn't happen to me

Oh, how you laughed at my complete lack of grace
But I could not recall a more perfect fall
'Cause when I looked up into your eyes
It didn't hurt at all

This could be a brand new start with you""

1071,72,Slow Down (Radio),Bobby Valentino,,,"THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of Emergency Medicine confirms it: Each year, between one and two dozen adult US males are admitted to ERs after having castrated themselves. With kitchen tools, usually, sometimes wire cutters. In answer to the obvious question, surviving patients most often report that their sexual urges had become a source of intolerable conflict and anxiety. The desire for perfect release and the real-world impossibility of perfect, whenever-you-want-it release had together produced a tension they could no longer stand.

It is to the 30+ testosteronically afflicted males whose cases have been documented in the past two years that your correspondents wish to dedicate this article. And to those tormented souls considering autocastration in 1998, we wish to say: “Stop! Stay your hand! Hold off with those kitchen utensils and/or wire cutters!” Because we believe we may have found an alternative.

Every spring, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences presents awards for outstanding achievement in all aspects of mainstream cinema. These are the Academy Awards. Mainstream cinema is a major industry in the United States, and so are the Academy Awards. The AAs’ notorious commercialism and hypocrisy disgust many of the millions and millions and millions of viewers who tune in during prime time to watch the presentations. It is not a coincidence that the Oscars ceremony is held during TV’s Sweeps Week. We pretty much all tune in, despite the grotesquerie of watching an industry congratulate itself on its pretense that it’s still an art form, of hearing people in $5,000 gowns invoke lush clichés of surprise and humility scripted by publicists, etc.—the whole cynical postmodern deal—but we all still seem to watch. To care. Even though the hypocrisy hurts, even though opening grosses and marketing strategies are now bigger news than the movies themselves, even though Cannes and Sundance have become nothing more than enterprise zones. But the truth is that there’s no more real joy about it all anymore. Worse, there seems to be this enormous unspoken conspiracy where we all pretend that there’s still joy. That we think it’s funny when Bob Dole does a Visa ad and Gorbachev shills for Pizza Hut. That the whole mainstream celebrity culture is rushing to cash in and all the while congratulating itself on pretending not to cash in. Underneath it all, though, we know the whole thing sucks.

Your correspondents humbly offer an alternative.

Every January, the least pretentious city in America hosts the Annual AVN Awards. The AVN stands for Adult Video News, which is sort of the Variety of the US porn industry. This thick, beautifully designed magazine costs $7.95 per issue, is about 80 percent ads, and is clearly targeted at adult-video retailers. Its circulation is appr. 40,000.

Though the sub-line vagaries of entertainment accounting are legendary, it is universally acknowledged that the US adult-film industry, at $3.5-4 billion in annual sales, rentals, cable charges, and video-masturbation-booth revenues, is an even larger and more efficient moneymaking machine than legitimate mainstream American cinema (the latter’s annual gross commonly estimated at $2-2.5 billion). The US adult industry is centered in LA’s San Fernando Valley, just over the mountains from Hollywood.1 Some insiders like to refer to the adult industry as Hollywood’s Evil Twin, others as the mainstream’s Big Red Son.

It is no accident that Adult Video News—a slick, expensive periodical whose articles are really more like infomercials—and its yearly Awards both came into being in 1982. The early ’80s, after all, saw the genesis of VCRs and home-video rentals, which have done for the adult industry pretty much what TV did for pro football.

From the 12/11/97 press release issued by AVN (visitable also at www.avn.com):

- The nominations for the 15th Annual AVN Awards were announced today.2 This year’s awards show, commemorating AVN’s 15th anniversary, celebrates “History”. [sic]

- Awards will be presented in a record 106 categories over a two night period.

- The adult industry released nearly 8,000 adult releases [sic] in 1997, including over 4,000 “new” releases (non-compilation). AVN reviewed every new release in every categroy [sic] this past year, logging over 30,000 sex scenes.3

- By comparison, last year there were approximately 375 films eligible for the Academy Awards that these voters [sic—meaning different voters from the AVN voters, presumably] were required to see. AVN had to watch more than 10 times the amount of releases in order to develop these nominations [usage and repetition sic, though 4,000 divided by 375 is indeed over 10].

From the acceptance speech of Mr. Tom Byron, Saturday, 10 January 1998, Caesars Forum ballroom, Caesars Palace Hotel and Casino complex, Las Vegas NV, upon winning AVN’s 1998 Male Performer of the Year Award (and with no little feeling): “I want to thank every beautiful woman I ever put my cock inside.” [Laughter, cheers, ovation.]

From the acceptance speech of Ms. Jeanna Fine, ibid., upon winning AVN’s 1998 Best Supporting Actress Award for her role in Rob Black’s Miscreants: “Jesus, which one is this for, Miscreants? Jesus, that’s another one where I read the script and said ‘Oh shit, I am going to go to hell. [Laughter, cheers.] But that’s okay, ’cause all my friends’ll be there too!” [Huge wave of laughter, cheers, applause.]

From the inter-Award banter of Mr. Bobby Slayton, professional comedian and master of ceremonies for the 1997 AVNAs: “I know I’m looking good, though, like younger, ’cause I started using this special Grecian Formula—every time I find a gray hair, I fuck my wife in the ass. [No laughter, scattered groans.] Fuck you. That’s a great joke. Fuck you.”

Bobby Slayton, a gravelly-voiced Dice Clay knockoff who kept introducing every female performer as “the woman I’m going to cut my dick off for,” and who astounded all the marginal print journalists in attendance with both his unfunniness and his resemblance to every apartment-complex coke dealer we’d ever met, is mercifully absent from the 1998 Awards gala. The ’98 emcee is one Robert Schimmel, alumnus of In Living Color and a Howard Stern regular. Schimmel looks like a depraved, deeply tan Wallace Shawn and is no less coarse than B. Slayton but a lot better. He does a pantomime of someone attempting intercourse with a Love Doll he’s been too lazy to blow up all the way. He contrasts the woeful paucity of his own ejaculate with the concussive orgasms of certain well-known male performers,4 comparing these men’s ejaculations to automatic lawn sprinklers and doing an eerie sonic impression of same. All of 1998’s marginal print journalists are together at Table 189 at the very back of the ballroom. Most of these reporters are from the sorts of men’s magazines that sit shrinkwrapped behind the cash registers of convenience stores, and they are a worldly and jaded crew indeed, but Schimmel gets a couple of them—whose noms de guerre are Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth—laughing so uproariously that people at the Anabolic Video table nearby keep looking over in annoyance. At one point during a routine on premature ejaculation, Dick Filth actually chokes on a California roll.

… But all this is Saturday night, the main event. And there are a whole lot of festivities preceding Saturday’s climax.

The adult industry is vulgar. Would anyone disagree? One of the AVN Awards’ categories is “Best Anal Themed Feature”; another is “Best Overall Marketing Campaign—Company Image.” Irresistible, a 1983 winner in several categories, has been spelled Irresistable in Adult Video News for fifteen straight years. The industry’s not only vulgar, it’s predictably vulgar. All the clichés are true. The typical porn producer really is the ugly little man with a bad toupee and a pinkie-ring the size of a Rolaids. The typical porn director really is the guy who uses the word class as a noun to mean refinement. The typical porn starlet really is the lady in Lycra eveningwear with tattoos all down her arms who’s both smoking and chewing gum while telling journalists how grateful she is to Wadcutter Productions Ltd. for footing her breast-enlargement bill. And meaning it. The whole AVN Awards weekend comprises what Mr. Dick Filth calls an Irony-Free Zone.

But of course we should keep in mind that vulgar has many dictionary definitions and that only a couple of these have to do w/ lewdness or bad taste. At root, vulgar just means popular on a mass scale. It is the semantic opposite of pretentious or snobby. It is humility with a comb-over. It is Nielsen ratings and Barnum’s axiom and the real bottom line. It is big, big business.

Thirty-four-year-old porn actor Cal Jammer killed himself in 1995. Starlets Shauna Grant, Nancy Kelly, Alex Jordan, and Savannah have all killed themselves in the last decade. Savannah and Jordan received AVN’s Best New Starlet awards in 1991 and 1992, respectively. Savannah killed herself after getting mildly disfigured in a car accident. Alex Jordan is famous for having addressed her suicide note to her pet bird. Crewman and performer Israel Gonzalez killed himself at a porn company warehouse in 1997.

An LA-based support group called PAW (=Protecting Adult Welfare) runs a 24-hour crisis line for people in the adult industry. A fundraiser for PAW was held at a Mission Hills CA bowling alley last November. It was a nude bowling tournament. Dozens of starlets agreed to take part. Two or three hundred adult-video fans showed up and paid to watch them bowl naked. No production companies or their executives participated or gave money. The fundraiser took in $6,000, which is slightly less than two one-millionths of porn’s yearly gross.

As you know if you’ve seen Casino, Showgirls, Bugsy, etc., there are really three Las Vegases. Binion’s, where the World Series of Poker is always played, exemplifies the “Old Vegas,” centered around Fremont Street. Las Vegas’s future is even now under late-stage construction at the very end of the Strip, on the outskirts of town (where US malls always go up); it’s to be a bunch of theme-parkish, more “family-oriented” venues of the kind that De Niro describes so plangently at the end of Casino.

But Las Vegas as most of us see it, Vegas qua Vegas, comprises the dozen or so hotels that flank the Strip’s middle. Vegas Populi: the opulent, intricate, garish, ecstatically decadent hotels, cathedra to gambling, partying, and live entertainment of the most microphone- swinging sort. The Sands. The Sahara. The Stardust. MGM Grand, Maxim. All within a small radius. Yearly utility expenditures on neon well into seven figures. Harrah’s, Casino Royale (with its big 24-hour Denny’s attached), Flamingo Hilton, Imperial Palace. The Mirage, with its huge laddered waterfall always lit up. Circus Circus. Treasure Island, with its intricate facade of decks and rigging and mizzens and vang. The Luxor, shaped like a ziggurat from Babylon of yore. Barbary Coast, whose sign out front says CASH YOUR PAYCHECK—WIN UP TO $25,000. These hotels are the Vegas we know. The land of Lola and Wayne. Of Siegfried and Roy, Copperfield. Showgirls in towering headdress. Sinatra’s sandbox. Most of them built in the ’50s and ’60s, the era of mob chic and entertainment-cum-industry. Half-hour lines for taxis. Smoking not just allowed but encouraged. Toupees and convention nametags and women in furs of all hue. A museum that features the World’s Biggest Coke Bottle. The Harley-Davidson Cafe, with its tympanum of huge protruding hawg; Bally’s H&C, with its row of phallic pillars all electrified and blinking in grand mal sync. A city that pretends to be nothing but what it is, an enormous machine of exchange—of spectacle for money, of sensation for money, of money for more money, of pleasure for whatever be tomorrow’s abstract cost.

Nor let us forget Vegas’s synecdoche and beating heart. It’s kittycorner from Bally’s: Caesars Palace. The granddaddy. As big as 20 Wal-Marts end to end. Real marble and fake marble, carpeting you can pass out on without contusion, 130,000 square feet of casino alone. Domed ceilings, clerestories, barrel vaults. In Caesars Palace is America conceived as a new kind of Rome: conqueror of its own people. An empire of Self. It’s breathtaking. The winter’s light rain makes all the neon bleed. The whole thing is almost too pretty to stand. There could be no site but Las Vegas’s Caesars for modern porn’s Awards show—here, the AAVNAs are one more spectacle. Way more tourists and conventioneers recognize the starlets than you’d expect. Double-takes all over the hotel. Even just standing around or putting coins in a slot machine, the performers become a prime attraction. Las Vegas doesn’t miss a trick.

The Annual AVN Awards are always scheduled to coincide with the International Consumer Electronics Show (a.k.a. CES), which this year runs from 8 through 11 January. The CES is a very big deal. It’s like a combination convention and talent show for the best and brightest in the world of consumer tech. Steve Forbes is here, and DSS’s Thomson. Sun Microsystems is using this year’s CES to launch its PersonalJava 1.0. Bill Gates gives a packed-house speech on Saturday morning. Major players from TV, cable, and merchandising host a panel on the short-term viability of HDTV. A forum on the problem of product returns by disgruntled customers seats 1,500 and is SRO. The CES as a whole is bigger than your correspondents’ hometowns. It’s spread out over four different hotels and has 10,000+ booths with everything from “The First Ever Full Text Message Pager in a Wristwatch” to the world’s premier self-heating home satellite dish (“The Snow and Ice Solution!”).

But far and away the CES’s most popular venue, with total attendance well over 100,000 every year, is what is called the Adult Software5 exhibition, despite the fact that the CES itself treats the Adult tradeshow kind of like the crazy relative in the family and keeps it way out in what used to be the parking garage of the Sands hotel. This facility, a serious bus ride from all the other CES sites, is an enormous windowless all-cement space that during show hours manages to induce both agoraphobia and claustrophobia. A big sign says you have to be 21 to get in. The median age inside is 45, almost all males, nearly everyone wearing some sort of conventioneer’s nametag. Every production company in the adult industry, from Anabolic to Zane, has a booth here. The really big companies have booths that are sprawling and multidisplay and more like small strip malls. A lot of porn’s top female performers are contract players, exclusive vendors to one particular production company; and one reason why a lot of the starlets seem kind of tired and cranky by Saturday night’s Awards gala is that they will have spent much of the previous 72 hours at their companies’ CES booths, on their feet all day in vertiginous heels, signing autographs and posing for pictures and pressing all manner of flesh.

The best way to describe the sonic environment at the ’98 CES is: Imagine that the apocalypse took the form of a cocktail party. Male fans move through the fractal maze of booths in groups of three or more. Their expressions tend to be those of junior-high boys at a peephole, an expression that looks pretty surreal on a face with jowls and no hairline. Some among them are video retailers; most are not. Most are just hard-core fans, the industry’s breath and bread. A lot of them not only recognize but seem to know the names, stage names, and curricula vitae of almost all the female performers.

It takes an average of two hours and twelve minutes to traverse the Adult CES expo, counting an average of four delays for getting lost after a chicane turn or some baroque ceiling-high cheval glass designed to double the visual exposure of Heatwave Video’s display for Texas Dildo Masquerade gets you all turned around. Your correspondents are accompanied by Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth, who have very generously offered to act as guides and docents, and here is a random spatter of the things we see the first time we come in:

A second-tier Arrow Video starlet in a G-string poses for a photo, forked dorsally over the knee of a morbidly obese cellphone retailer from suburban Philadelphia. The guy taking the picture, whose CES nametag says Hi and that his name is Sherm, addresses the starlet as “babe” and asks her to readjust so as to “give us a little more bush down there.” An Elegant Angel starlet with polyresin wings attached to her back is eating a Milky Way bar while she signs video boxes. Actor Steven St. Croix is standing near the Caballero Home Video booth, saying to no one in particular “Let me out of here, I can’t wait to get out of here.”6 Adult-video stores all have a distinctive smell—a mix of cheap magnetic tape and disinfectant—and the Sands’ former parking garage is rank with it. Asian businessmen move through the aisles in dense graceful packs and are assiduously cheery and polite. A young guy in a full-color Frankenstein T-shirt is spraypainting cartoon flames on an actress’s breasts at the Sin City booth. The actress—an obscure one, not even Filth and Hecuba know her name—has normal-size breasts, and there’s not much of an audience. Producer/director Max Hardcore draws a way bigger crowd at the MAXWORLD booth, where one of his girls is squatting on the countertop masturbating with the butt of a riding crop. Max’s videos’ promotional posters have him carrying a girl in minishorts over his shoulder against the backdrop of various city skylines; the pitches at the bottom say “SEE PRETTY GIRLS SODOMIZED IN MANNERS MOST FOUL! SEE CUM-SPLATTERED GIRLS TOO STUPID TO KNOW BETTER!” Max is a story all to himself, according to Harold Hecuba. D. Filth and a porn executive dressed entirely in Campbell Nightwatch plaid are smoking cigars and keep holding their cigars up together and comparing the ash to see which one has the cleanest burn. A lot of the industry males and even some of the starlets are also smoking cigars. 1998 is definitely the Year of the Cigar. The starlets are all in either extremely formal cocktail dresses or else abbreviated latex/vinyl/ Lycra ensembles. Heels are uniformly sharp and ultrahigh. Some of the starlets are so heavily made up they look embalmed. They tend to have complexly coiffed hair that looks really good from 20 feet away but on closer inspection is dry and dead. Someone who is either sometime-performer Jeff Marton or “Bizarro-Sleaze” filmmaker Gregory Dark is doing sleight-of-hand tricks with his trademark fedora.7 Whoever he is, he has a goatee. Harold Hecuba also has a goatee; Dick Filth has more like a soul patch. H.H. and D.F., longtime industry journalists, know everybody here and keep getting stopped and drawn into conversations. (These delays, during which yr. corresps. sort of stand there awkwardly at the edge of the conversation and try to look around as if they too know people here and are waiting only to spot them in the crowd before they go off and get into their own involved conversations, have not been included in the 132-minute Adult CES-traversal average.) This year, a good 75 percent of the males in and around the porn industry appear to be sporting variants of the goatee.8

Next to the Outlaw Video booth, a starlet in a gold lamé spaghetti-strap gown, chewing gum and blowing large blue bubbles, is being videotaped by a disabled fan whose camera and parabolic mike are bolted to the arm of his wheelchair; the starlet is pointing to the tattoos on her left arm and appears to be explaining the origin and context of each one. At the Vivid Video multibooth complex,9 Ms. Taylor Hayes has what is probably the longest autograph-and-flesh-press line in the entire Sands garage. Taylor is major-league pretty—she looks like a slightly debauched Cindy Crawford—and an oversize monitor suspended from the ceiling over the Vivid area plays clips of her scantily clad and dancing amid dry-ice fumes. There’s a berm of boxed videos on the floor by the counter and a huge man with a visor and handheld credit card machine on Taylor’s right flank as she greets each fan like a long-lost relative. According to Dick Filth, Taylor is both a genuinely nice person and a consummate pro.

The booth for XPlor Media—a company known for its “Southern Belles” video series and ORGY FOR WORLD PEACE Website—is arresting because all the execs at XPlor seem to be under 25 and the booth’s atmosphere is that of a fraternity party in its third straight day. One young bald guy is unconscious in a fetal position on the counter, and some wag has glued all sorts of feathers and flaccid plastic two-headed dildoish things to his skull. XPlor’s owner-auteurs are two brothers, trust-fund babies from a Connecticut suburb of NYC. Their names are Farrel and Moffitt Timlake. Farrel, who wears twelve-hole Doc Martens and cargo pants and what’s either a very light parka or very heavy sweatshirt with a hood that stays up at all times, is a particular cause célèbre at the ’98 CES because he’s apparently a friend of the two guys who do South Park, and these guys are rumored to be in Vegas and to possess tickets to Saturday’s Awards banquet.10

Everyone without exception is sweating. At all but a few of the booths, contract starlets treat the fans with the same absent, rigid-faced courtesy that flight attendants and restaurant hostesses tend to use. You can tell how bored the performers are by the way their faces light up when they see someone they know. Well over half of the industry’s current superstars are in this huge room.11 The infamous T.T. Boy is here, standing alone with his trademark glower, the Boy who is rumored to bring a semiautomatic pistol with him to the set and who was featured in a 1995 New Yorker article that was full of lines like “A porn shoot is an intricately delineated ecology.” Mr. Vince Vouyer (sic) is on hand, as are Seth Gecko, Jake Steed, Serenity, Missy, and Nick East. Here is the ageless Randy West, who looks just the way a surfer would look if that surfer were also a Mob enforcer, with his perennial tan and hair like frozen surf. Mr. Jon Dough—winner of AVN’s coveted Best Actor/Video statuette in both ’96 and ’97—alternates between various booths, wearing his customary expression of having psychologically evolved to the point where he’s so incredibly cool and detached that life is one long yawn. Here also is Mark Davis, far and away the most handsome of the current males, a near-double for Gregory Harrison of the old Trapper John series except for Davis’s ultrashort psych-patient haircut (plus goatee).

And 20-year veteran Joey Silvera is at this year’s CES, though mostly in his capacity as an auteur: Silvera now directs Evil Angel’s popular “Butt Row” video series.12 Following the lead of pioneers like John Leslie and Paul Thomas, most of today’s top male stars now also direct (and, per the store boxes, “Present”) their own line of videos, e.g. “Tom Byron’s Cumback Pussy” series, “Jon Dough’s Dirty Stories,” the eye-popping Rocco Siffredi’s “[Various European Cities] By Night” line, etc. The So-and-So Presents series seems to be an industry trend, like cigars and goatees.

It is difficult to describe how it feels to gaze at living human beings whom you’ve seen perform in hard-core porn. To shake the hand of a man whose precise erectile size, angle, and vasculature are known to you. That strange I-think-we’ve-met-before sensation one feels upon seeing any celebrity in the flesh is here both intensified and twisted. It feels intensely twisted to see reigning industry queen Jenna Jameson chilling out at the Vivid booth in Jordaches and a latex bustier and to know already that she has a tattoo of a sundered valentine with the tagline HEART BREAKER on her right buttock and a tiny hairless mole just left of her anus. To watch Peter North try to get a cigar lit and to have that sight backlit by memories of his artilleryesque ejaculations.13 To have seen these strangers’ faces in orgasm—that most unguarded and purely neural of expressions, the one so vulnerable that for centuries you basically had to marry a person to get to see it.14 This weirdness may account for some of the complex emotional intercourse taking place between the performers and fans at the Adult CES. The patrons may leer and elbow one another at a distance, but by the time the men get to the front of the line and face the living incarnation of their VCR’s fantasy-babe, most of them turn into quivering goggle-eyed schoolboys, sheepish and salivaless and damp. The same thing evidently happens at the hundreds of strip clubs all over the country where porn starlets appear as Featured Dancers (for five figures a week, according to Filth) and do photos and autographs after the show:

“Most of these guys become incredibly nervous when I come up to them,” veteran starlet Shane has explained. “I’ll put my arms around a guy and his whole body will be trembling. They pretty much do whatever I tell them to do.” The whole industry, now, has this oddly reversed equation—the consumers are the ones who seem ashamed or shy, while the performers are cocky and smooth and 100 percent pro.
It is no longer the 1980s, and the Meese Commission mentality that led to a major crackdown on video porn is long gone. Federal task forces and PTA outrage are now focused on the Internet and kiddie porn. But today’s adult industry is still hypersensitive about what it perceives as fascist attacks on its First Amendment freedoms. A specially prepared trailer now runs before many higher-end adult videos, right between the legal disclaimer on the product’s compliance with or exemption from 18 U.S.C §2257 and ads for phone services like 900-666-FUCK. Against shots of flowing flags and the Lincoln Memorial, a voiceover says stuff like:

Censorship goes against our Bill of Rights and the founding principles of this country. It is an attempt on the part of the government to legislate morality and to stifle free expression.15 This new, “legal” morality is dangerous to all Americans. Vote for those who believe in limiting government intrusion into your personal affairs. Vote against government control of your life and home. Vote against censorship. Only you, the People, can keep the American ideal intact.

These trailers always say they’re sponsored by either the Adult Video Association or something called the Free Speech Coalition. Both organizations (and the extent to which the two are separate is unclear) are basically industry PACs. Porn, in other words, has taken the political lessons of the ’80s to heart; it is now a hard-lobbying political force no less than GM or RJR Nabisco.

Feminists of all different stripe oppose the adult industry for reasons having to do with pornography’s putative effects on women. Their arguments are well-known and in some respects persuasive. But certain antiporn arguments in the 1990s are now centered on adult entertainment’s alleged effects on the men who consume it. Some “masculists” believe that a lot of men get addicted to video porn in a way that causes grievous psychic harm. Example: An essayist named David Mura has a little book called A Male Grief: Notes on Pornography and Addiction, which is a bit New Agey but interesting in places, e.g.:

At the essence of pornography is the image of flesh used as a drug, a way of numbing psychic pain. But this drug lasts only as long as the man stares at the image… . In pornographic perception, each gesture, each word, each image, is read first and foremost through sexuality. Love or tenderness, pity or compassion, become subsumed by, and are made subservient to, a “greater” deity, a more powerful force… . The addict to pornography desires to be blinded, to live in a dream. Those in the thrall of pornography try to eliminate from their consciousness the world outside pornography, and this includes everything from their family and friends or last Sunday’s sermon to the political situation in the Middle East. In engaging in such elimination the viewer reduces himself. He becomes stupid.

This kind of stuff might sound a little out-there, maybe, until one observes the eerie similarity between the eyes of males in strip clubs or stroke parlors and the eyes of people in their fifth hour of pumping silver dollars into the slot machines of the Sands’ casino, or maybe until one’s seen firsthand the odd kind of shock on the faces of CES patrons seeing performers now “in the flesh,” complete with chewing gum and chin-pimples and all the human stuff you never see—never want to see—in films.

Maybe just a little bit more here on the whole scene at the Adult CES, which is a lot more of a rub-elbows-type venue than the stylized Awards ceremony is going to end up being… . Mr. Harold Hecuba is deep in conversation with a marginal porn producer about one of his performers’ being sidelined with something called a “prolapsed sphincter,” which condition yr. corresps. decline to follow up on in any way. We are standing just west of a staff writer for Digital Horizons who’s dropped by to scope out the legendary scene in here again this year and is telling two presumed other tech writers that being around porn people always makes him feel like he’s been somehow astrally projected onto a cocktail napkin. It is also roughly now that Ms. Jasmin St. Claire is making an appearance at the Impressive Media booth in order to spell the starlet behind the counter, who is limping to the booth’s rear area; she (i.e., the limping starlet) has (reportedly) had to be sprayed with silicon to fit into her pants. The crowd at the Impressive Media venue immediately starts to enlarge. Jasmin St. Claire is wearing a red vinyl jacket-and-miniskirt ensemble. A porn starlet entering any kind of room or area has a distinctive energy about her—you turn your head to look even if you don’t seem to want to. It’s like watching a figure from a pinball machine illustration or high-concept comic book step out into 3-D and head your way. It turns out really to be possible to feel as though your eyeballs are protruding slightly from their sockets. What makes the whole thing so weird is that Jasmin St. Claire isn’t even all that pretty, at least not today. Her hair is dyed black in that cheap unreal Goth way, and she is so incredibly heavily made up that she looks like a crow. (She is also somewhat knock-kneed, plus of course has the requisite Howitzer-grade bust.) Ms. St. Claire is being escorted to the Impressive booth by two large men whose expressions are describable only as mug-shottish. This is another thing about porn starlets—they’re never alone. They’re always accompanied by at least one and sometimes as many as four flinty-eyed males. The impression is that of a very expensive thoroughbred being led onto the track under a silk blanket.

FYI, Ms. Jasmin St. Claire’s cult-celebrity status at the ’98 CES stems from her having broken the “World Gang Bang Record”16 by taking on 300 men in a row in Amazing Pictures’ 1996 World’s Biggest Gang Bang 2. Since most of these 300 men were amateur porn-fans who’d had only to fill out an application and produce an HIV all-clear from the DPH, she now enjoys an almost legendary populist appeal—“the People’s Porn Star”—and an enormous serpentine line of fans with cameras and autographable memorabilia has formed at the Impressive booth, which line Ms. St. Claire appears for the moment to be ignoring, because she and H. Hecuba, having exchanged double-cheek kisses, are now deep into some kind of tête-à-tête above the sockless Docksiders of the unconscious bald kid, who’s (the kid has) evidently been carried or trundled by pranksters unknown from the XPlor counter (right next door) to this one. Dick Filth—after your correspondents have remarked on how it’s kind of heartwarming that everyone in the porn industry all seem to be friends, even critics and performers—dishes an involved anecdote about how Jasmin St. Claire apparently once actually tried to strangle Harold Hecuba at an industry soirée a couple years ago, an anecdote which, if you’re interested, "

The foregoing is meant to help explain how exactly your correspondents ended up in porn titan Max Hardcore’s personal suite at the Sahara and got to hang out in the suite’s living room with Max, certain of his crew, porn starlets Alex Dane and Caressa Savage, and two B-girls—which is to say that it was actually Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth who were invited to hang out in the suite on Friday afternoon, and the burly MAXWORLD Production Assistant wasn’t quick enough about slamming the door.,,
So yr. corresps. were, for a couple hours, at least logistically speaking, In.,,,

For a regular civilian male, hanging out in a hotel suite with porn starlets is a tense and emotionally convolved affair. There is, first, the matter of having seen the various intimate activities and anatomical parts of these starlets in videos heretofore and thus (weirdly) feeling shy about meeting them. But there is also a complex erotic tension. Because porn films’ worlds are so sexualized, an unlocked door, a cocked eyebrow, a firm handshake—to send everyone tumbling into a tangled mass of limbs and orifices
,,,,,,
Mr. Max Hardcore—a.k.a. Max Steiner, a.k.a. Paul Steiner," né Paul Little—is 5'6"""" and a very fit 135. He is somewhere between 40 and 60 years old and resembles more than anything a mesomorphic and borderline-psycho Henry Gibson. He is wearing a black cowboy hat and what has to be one of the very few long-sleeved Hawaiian shirts in existence anywhere. Once the PA guarding the door mellows out and introductions are made (H.H. managing to drop the name of this magazine several times in one sentence)", Max reveals himself to be a genial and garrulous host and offers everybody disposable plastic cups of vodka before settling in with yr. corresps. to discuss what for Max are the most pressing and relevant issues at this year’s AVN Awards, reputation, personal history, and overall life philosophy of Mr. Max Hardcore.
,,,,,,
Pioneered (depending whom you talk to) by either Max Hardcore or John (“Buttman”) Stagliano, “Gonzo” has become one of this decade’s most popular and profitable genres of adult video. It’s more or less a cross between an MTV documentary and the Hell panel from Bosch’s Garden of Earthly Delights. A Gonzo film is always set at some distinctive locale or occasion—Daytona Beach at spring break, the Cannes Film Festival, etc. There’s always a randy and salivous “host” talking directly to a handheld camera: “Well and we’re here at the Cannes Film Festival, John Travolta and Sigourney Weaver are supposed to both be in town, and there’s also the world-famous beach, and I’m told there’s always some real seriously good-looking little girls at the beach
,,,,,,
The issue of who exactly invented Gonzo being impossibly vexed and so notwithstanding, it is true that Max Hardcore is famous as a director for several things: (1) Being incredibly disciplined about budgets and tactical logistics, right down to forcing his crew and staff to wear identical jumpsuits of scarlet nylon so that they look like a national ski team—Max’s shoots are described (by Max) as “almost military operations”; (2) Not only employing ringers but actually sometimes being able to talk real live civilian “little girls” on the beach or in the mall into coming on back to the special MAXWORLD RV and having anal sex on camera;22 (3) Being the first in “mainstream” (meaning nonfetish) adult video to perpetrate on women levels of violation and degradation that would have been unthinkable even a few years ago. W/r/t item (3), Max, informs us that he is and always has been adult video’s “cutting-edge blade,” and that other less bold and original filmmakers have systematically stolen and used his, Max’s

Alone and in a place of conspicuous honor on a wood-finish shelf above the suite’s minibar is an actual AVN Awards statuette. The trophy resembles an Oscar/Emmy/Clio except that the figurine’s arms are up and out (making it also look a bit like Richard Nixon at the climax of the ’68 GOP convention), and something slightly blurry about the casting gives it a sort of cubic-zirconium aspect. Whether the statuette is heavy and solid vs. hollow and Little Leaguish remains unknown—there is no invitation to touch or heft it. One of the B-girls on the couch is now either laughing or weeping into her hands at something Harold Hecuba has said; her bare shoulders heave. It would be totally fantastic if the Seinfeld rerun on the huge TV were the episode about everybody trying to refrain from masturbating, but it isn’t.,,,,
,,,,,,
Asked by one of yr. corresps. what he won this AVN Award on the shelf for, Max Hardcore slaps his knee: “I fucking stole it.” It’s now that hard middle-distance inspection reveals that the MAX HARDCORE on the metal strip at the trophy’s base has been scratched in by someone who is not a professional engraver. It looks done with a screwdriver, in fact. Max expands on the statuette caper: Shut inexplicably out of the Awards for years, he last year, which he regards as the AVNAs’ way of twisting the emotional blade), espied in the wings a large cardboard box filled with blank and unused AVN Award statuettes.24 Whereupon he thought, as he now puts it

Alex Dane is now telling Harold Hecuba about a stray dog she found and has decided to keep. She is excited as she describes the dog and for a moment seems about fourteen; the impression lasts only a second or two and is heartbreaking. One of the B-girls, meanwhile, is explaining that she has just gotten a pair of cutting-edge breast implants that she can actually adjust the size of by adding or draining fluid via small valves under her armpits, and then—perhaps mistaking your correspondents’ expressions for ones of disbelief—she raises her arms to display the valves. There really are what appear to be valves.,,,

So much about today’s adult industry seems like an undeft parody of Hollywood and the nation writ large. The top performers are comic-book caricatures of sexual allure. The prosthetic breasts and lifted buttocks and (no kidding) artificial cheekbones are nothing more than accentuations of a mentality that yields huge liposuction and collagen industries. The gynecologically explicit sexuality of Jenna, Jasmin, et al. seems more than anything like a Mad magazine spoof of the “smoldering” sexuality of Sharon Stone and Madonna and so many other mainstream iconettes.25 Not to mention the fact that the adult industry takes many of the psychological deformities that Hollywood is famous for—the vanity, the vulgarity,,,

Good old Max Hardcore, for instance, is a total psychopath—that’s part of his on-screen Gonzo persona—but so is the real Max/Paul Steiner. You’d almost have to have been there in that suite. Max sits holding court in his hat and pointy boots, looking at once magisterial and mindless, the first ten minutes of the impromptu interview in the Sahara are spent passing around a copy of something called Icon magazine, which Max has told us is doing a profile on him—we are expected to leaf through the magazine and comment favorably on its content and layout while Max watches us in the same hyperexpectant way that parents watch you when you’re looking at a snapshot of their kid that they’ve taken out uninvited and pressed on you. This is the actual chronology. There then follows a torrent of autobiography and background that yr. corresps. have decided to deny Max the satisfaction of seeing reproduced here. After which is a kind of Max 101-like survey of personal philosophy and Gonzo theory and the statuette anecdote. The vodka is top-shelf and the plastic cups dusty. Then one of the starlets decides that she’s hungry, and Max insists on escorting her down to the Sahara’s restaurant and wants everybody else to come along

Doubtless most of this is going to get cut by Premiere, but it’s worth also observing—when this magazine’s assigned photographer (who’s also gotten in here with us this afternoon on H.H. and D.F.’s coattails) begins wondering aloud about the possibility of getting some good portraits at the Awards of winners holding their statuettes—the way Max right away jumps in with his idea of the perfect photo for the title page of this very article. The proposed shot is to be of Max Hardcore, holding several of the AVN Awards trophies he pledges either to win straight up or to gain possession of in other ways, seated in some kind of imperial-looking and really nice chair that is itself set up on the palm-studded boulevard of the famous Las Vegas Strip—so the photographer’ll get lots of smeary neon and appropriately phallic bldgs. in the background—with a retinue of scantily clad starlets either draped swoonily over him or prostrate at his feet, no irony or embarrassment or self-awareness of any sort on Max’s face as he sketches this photo’s tableau for us; he’s in the kind of earnest that one imagines Irving Thalberg was always in.29 Your correspondents immediately begin to lobby hard for Max’s idea, figuring that the photo would make a great illustration for the story of Max’s proposing this very photo—i.e., that it would point up the megalomania far more powerfully than mere reportage—but the Premiere photographer

Saturday’s the big night. The banquet, the onstage entertainment, the headline Awards. See & be seen. Gamblers and conventioneers and mooks of all ilk are massed at the Caesars cabstand to watch the starlets arrive. There are camcorders and flashbulbs but no paparazzi per se. Some of the performers come in limos, others in shiny penile sports cars; others seem to mysteriously just suddenly appear. There are even more starlets here than there were at the CES," but none of these escorts are male porn performers. Average heel-height is 4""""+. A loud-voiced civilian in the cabstand crowd actually utters the phrase “Va Va Voom",” which yr. correspondents had never before heard anywhere outside a Sinatra movie. Breasts are uniformly zeppelinesque and in various perilous stages of semiconfinement. Max Hardcore is under a Stetson the color of weak chocolate milk, and his adjustable B-girl—arrayed in a type of scarlet cowboy suit that’s mostly fringe—has inflated her breasts to what’s got to be maximum capacity.

Woodman-wise, black is clearly In at the 15th Annual AVNAs. A lot of the men are in black tuxedos and black ties and black dress shirts. One is wearing a paisley suit of either serge or some kind of upholstery material. Another has silver platform shoes and a silver vest w/ no shirt underneath. The XPlor boys are in Klein sweatshirts and urban-camouflage fatigues, and there’s a large contingent with them that may or may not include the South Park brain trust. A guy on the arm of Ms. Morgan Fairlane has an immense and razorous violet mohawk à la British punks of the late 1970s.,,,,
,,,,,,
Inside the hotel, a kind of impromptu cocktail party forms in the broad marble hall outside Caesars Palace’s largest and reportedly classiest ballroom, which is called Caesars Forum. Burly casino staffers stand taking tickets and being very discouraging about anybody trying to bum-rush the show. The crush of bodies out here entails a degree of physical contact that CES mooks never even dreamed of. There are pockets of klieg-glare as cable TV reporters interview various performers about (sic:) the air of keen excitement in the air. Mysterious bundles of co-ax emerge from under the Forum doors and go all the way up the length of the hallway and disappear around the corner. A suspicion that we’d had all week but decided was unverifiable is now instantly verified when one of yr. corresps. gets accidentally shoved against a starlet and is jabbed in the side by her breasts and it hurts. A lot of people are holding drinks in plastic glasses and it’s unknown where they got them. The starlets take turns getting interviewed re atmospheric excitement while the woodmen all avoid the cameras like mafiosi. The TV lights are not doing anyone’s skin tone any good at all. In their all-black tuxes," several of the male Insiders—including e.g. John Leslie and Tony Tedeschi—are so pallid and sallow as to appear diseased. Mr. Nick East devotes a full 5.5 minutes of rapt concentration to the cuticle of his left thumb. A slight surprise is that a lot of the industry’s elite woodmen are short—5'6""""", a medium that apparently does all kinds of strange things to perspective.,,
,,,,,,
Tickets for Saturday’s main event are $195 per, in advance. It’s unclear whether any Insiders’ tickets are comped, but journalists pay full retail. Our tickets designate our table as #189. Twenty-five hundred tickets have been sold, and since it’s highly doubtful that anybody got past the flinty-eyed casino guys outside without a ticket,500,,
The Caesars Forum ballroom itself is a huge L-shape with the stage at the—as it were—joint; thus half of the 15th Annual AVN Awards’ audience is geometrically invisible to the other half. This problem is addressed via six sail-sized video screens that hang from the ceiling at strategic points throughout the auditorium. During the nearly two hours37 between when the doors open and the Awards show actually starts, the screens alternate quick clips from porn classics38 (recall that the theme of the 15th AAVNAs is “The History of Adult”) with live shots of various people making their entrances and mugging for the remote cameras AVN has got circling the room.,,,,,
,,,,,,
Both Harold Hecuba and Dick Filth have come equipped with binoculars (H.H.’s in a very official-looking Audubon Society case), which seems mysterious until we all arrive at Table 189, which is at the very, very back of the ballroom’s L’s northern leg,” Hecuba explains. This fact is unpleasant surprise #1. Unpleasant surprise #2 is the supper the $195 includes, which turns out to be buffet-steam-table-style and might best be described by inviting you to imagine a very cosmopolitan and multiethnic hospital cafeteria. 39 Several of the male Insiders, we now notice

Now moving w/ laden plate to a table near us is a man in a full-body leopardskin suit whose way of acknowledging people he knows is to point at them rather than wave at them. On his arm is a B-girl in a body stocking made of what appears to be a densely woven net. Two Astral Ocean Cinema contract starlets have on identical copper-colored beaded gowns with myriad lengthwise slits in the skirt parts’ fronts and backs and sides, so that as they walk to their table their upper halves look normal and their lower halves seem to be passing through an infinity of bead curtains. Obviously," the whole scene is overwhelming. The average American rarely gets to see aerobic legwarmers with 4"""" spike heels. The Caesars Forum ceiling is the color of rancid meringue; it has 24 chandeliers that are designed to look like concentric opened fans but actually look more like labia or very well-organized fungus. Mr. Joey Buttafuoco is in the house", accompanying40 Al Goldstein of Screw, the one where the nebbishy little stand-in for all mooks everywhere finally has sex with Bambi Woods and then the screen flashes “NEXT?” The South Park boys are indeed in attendance, up at Table 37 w/ Farrel and the XPlor coterie. There are also rumors that Boogie Nights auteur Paul Thomas Anderson possesses a ticket to the gala and might show up.41,
,,,,,,
The closest thing to any kind of Insider table near ours is #182, which according to its black table-tent is reserved for Anabolic Video (not an industry force) and is currently occupied by a spiriferously coiffed and sullenly chewing Dina Jewel (who declines to return Harold Hecuba’s blown kiss) and her escort, a young fellow whom one can easily envision head-butting somebody in a mosh pit. D. Filth confides that this Anabolic guy is a close friend of woodman Vince Vouyer (again, sic),,,
,,,,,,
It turns out that Hecuba and Filth have kept from yr. correspondents as unpleasant surprise #3 the single chintziest thing about the $195-a-head 15th AAVNAs banquet & gala: Beverages are not compris. And not just alcohol, either; even a lousy club soda w/ lime42 is $6.00. Worse, it turns out you can’t run any sort of tab—you have to pay the waiter in cash when you order the lousy club soda w/ lime, and he (theoretically) brings your change back with the beverage. Thus a separate and memory-intensive transaction is required for each drink that each of the six-to-eight persons at each of the appr. 375 tables in the auditorium might order, etc.43 The whole unfree-drink situation is incredibly annoying, not only because of the outlandish ticket price but because the ballroom’s 100 percent Middle Eastern waiters (decent and hardworking fellows all, to be sure
,,,,,,
The crowd lingers over hypersucrotic cake and coffee and $9.00 cordials and howls conversation at itself for 90 more minutes before the house lights dim and the 15th Annual AVN Awards gala starts. What follows thereon is a kaleidoscopic flux of stilted acceptances and blue one-liners and epileptic strobes and spotlights following winners’ serpentine and high five-studded paths to the stage, of everything from generic Awards Show schmaltz to moments of near-Periclean eloquence, as in e.g.:,,,,
,,,,,,
“Fellow MENSA members and aficionados of Shakespeare!” intones Al Goldstein of Screw, 62 and obese and white-bearded and crazy-haired and dressed in a sportcoat whose lapels are two different primary colors, looking pretty much exactly like that one certain old guy in the neighborhood your mom warned you never to try to sell Cub Scout chocolate mints to, and glorying in a Special AVN Achievement Award he confesses to feeling he’s long deserved. “I want to thank my mother, its modern Yeah-OK-I’m-Scum-but-Underneath-All-Your-Hypocrisy-So- Are-You-and-at-Least-I-Have-the-Guts-to-Admit-It-and-Have-a-Good-Time persona:,,
,,,,,,
“I salute the women with eleven-IQs and the men with eleven-inch cocks. The real heroes are the cocks and pussies who fuck on-screen. They’re the real heroes.” Goldstein is less conducted than borne back to his seat.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
This has followed Robert Schimmel’s intro and a 20-minute “Musical Salute to the History of Adult,” in which topless dancing girls do a medley of disco, new wave, and so on.46 The stage band is ragged and unevenly amplified,,,
,,,,,,
The whole 15th AAVNAs Show lasts 3.5 hours and resembles nothing so much as an obscene and extremely well-funded high school assembly. The mix of garish self-congratulation47 and clumsy choreography is often so weird as to be endearing. There are never fewer than six presenters for each award, and they never seem to know whose turn it is to announce a nominee, and there are always a couple who don’t get close enough to the mike to be audible and a couple others who get too close to the mike and produce a jolt of feedback that sends people and cocktails flying out of chairs in the first rows of tables. Wicked Pictures’ Satyr, a multiple-category nominee, but even people who’ve won and been through the process several times in recent years keep forgetting and trying to exit stage-right and colliding with the hostesses who are there to escort them leftward. Some presenters insert brief rote antidrug messages into their intros, while around them twitch and sniff other presenters—not many, but some—who are obviously coked to the gills.
,,,,,,
Probably the most neutral and economical thing to say is that large parts of the ceremony are unintentionally funny. Winning woodmen extend earnest thanks to directors and execs for giving them “an opening” or “a shot” or “my big shot” and seem wholly unaware of the carnal entendres involved. Back at the journalists’ table with us is a 40ish woman in two-piece Armani who’s doing a spot on the Awards for ABC Radio; she spends most of the evening hunched over with her head in her hand and her tape recorder not even on. Dick Filth spends the show’s whole second hour trying to track down a waiter who owes him beverage change. AVN’s Gene Ross pays tribute to ’98’s Male Performer of the Year by saying: “You haven’t lived until you’ve seen Tom Byron’s wrinkled nuts on a seventy-inch TV screen.” Rob Black’s Miscreants keeps getting nominated in category after category, and time and again there’s a frantic caucus at the podium about the correct pronunciation of miscreant, complete with a couple of presenters audibly whispering what in the fuck is the word even supposed to mean.48,,,,
,,,,,,
To be fair, some of the nominated products’ titles are genuinely confusing. Triple Penetration Debutante Sluts 4 is up for Most Outrageous Sex Scene—along with Wild Bananas on Butt Row and 87 and Still Bangin’—but loses out to a scene the Program entitles “Anal Food Express”49 from a video called My Girlfriend’s Girlfriend. Paul Thomas’s Bad Wives wins Best Film. Evil Angel’s Buda wins Best Shot-on-Video Feature. The Best Foreign Release statuette goes to something European called President By Day, Hooker By Night. Bad Wives also wins Best Actress/Film for Dyanna Lauren, Best Supporting Actress/Film for Melissa Hill, everybody. My gang bang was a blast.”51,,
,,,,,,
Max Hardcore, to Table 189’s immense and unkind delight, doesn’t win one single thing.,,,,
,,,,,,
An actor named Jim Buck wins AVN’s Gay Performer of the Year Award," and you better believe yr. corresps. sit bolt upright when the person who appears onstage to accept the award is a pink and leptosomatic 4'10"""" and is wearing an Eton collar and appears", even under 125X binoculation, to be a twelve-year-old boy. And it turns out it is a twelve-year-old boy: It’s Jim Buck’s little brother. “Jim can’t be here tonight because he’s performing in a Shakespeare festival in New Orleans, “but I’m here to thank you on his behalf, and to say that I taught Jim everything he knows.” [Enormous audience laugh and ovation, single spasmodic shudder from hunched ABC Radio lady.]
,,,,,,
A strange and traumatic experience which one of yr. corrs. will not even try to describe consists of standing at a men’s room urinal between professional woodmen Alex Sanders and Dave Hardman. Suffice it to say that the urge to look over/down at their penises is powerful and the motives behind this urge so complex as to cause anuresis (which in turn ups the trauma). Be informed that male porn stars create around themselves the exact same opaque affective privacy- bubble that all men at urinals everywhere create. The whole Caesars Forum’s men’s room’s urinal area is an angst festival; take it from us. The sink-and-mirror-and-towelette area, however, turns out to be a priceless mash of Insider jargon and shoptalk, all made extra-resonant by echolalic tile and a surfeit of six-dollar drinks. One performer-turned-auteur is telling a colleague about an exciting new project:,,,
,,,,,,
“Found this Russian, this chick like nineteen, can’t speak a word of English, which for this [ = for the exciting project] is perfect.”,,,
,,,,,,
“You going to get in there? Just for maybe like one scene?”,,,,,,
,,,,,,
“Nah. That’s the whole point. I’m the director. This is my package now.”,,,,,,
,,,,,,
“Oh man though but you got to get in there. Just one scene. Nineteen, no English. Probably got a butthole about this big” [illustrative gesture unseen because auditor is still standing complexly traumatized at urinal].,,,,,
,,,,,,
“Well, we’ll see.” [Mutual laughter replete w/ warmth of genuine friendship, fellow-feeling; exeunt.],,,,
,,,,,,
The Awards Show’s planners have obviously studied at the Oscars’ feet. Not only are the high-profile AVNAs held to the end—though with occasional teasers like Best Supporting thrown into the first two-thirds to keep people attentive52 —but the endless lists of categories and nominees are interspersed with little entr’actes of musical entertainment. Ms. Dyanna Lauren, for instance, appears between Best-Selling Tape and Best Foreign Release to sing her original composition “Psycho Magnet,” a hard-rock ballad about being a porn star and getting constantly stalked and harassed by mentally ill mooks. The song’s argumentation strikes yr. corresps. as a bit uneven, even with heavy amplification and digital synthesis, Dyanna Lauren sounds like a scalded cat, although Dick Filth points out that so does Alanis Morissette
,,,,,,
Hecuba’s claim seems unassailable until right before the Best Boxcover Concept category, when suddenly a piano is wheeled out for a chinless middle-aged man in the same sort of undersize porkpie that Art Carney always wore in The Honeymooners. This entertainer, who is introduced as “Doctor Dirty—the Dirtiest Musician in the History of Music,” proceeds to belt out obscene parodies of popular ditties that put Table 189 in mind of Mad magazine if everyone at Mad somehow all lost their mind at the same time. “Just got home from prison./My asshole is fizzin’./Goo goo goo drippin’ out my back door” is the only snatch of actual lyrics that persists in memory, but almost everyone agrees that he’s the ’98 gala’s low point and a credible rival for Scotty Schwartz’s 1997 seminude rendition of “Thank Heaven for Little Girls” as the most repellent AVNA interlude in modern memory. There’s also the ’98 ceremony’s climax, in which Midori53 and two other starlets take the stage as “the Spicy Girls” and do a rappish 4/4 number that ends with pretty much every female porn performer in the crowd54 up on stage dancing lasciviously and blowing kisses at the AVN cameras. This climactic distaff shindig apparently caps the Awards every year.,
,,,,,,
Something else happens every year. It’s never part of AVN’s videotape of the gala, but it’s a tradition that finally explains why the ballroom’s poor waiters are willing to spend five hours enduring beverage abuse and scuttling around to find change. After the Awards Show is over and the lights go up, some of the starlets always pose for obscene snapshots with the Forum’s waiters. A lot of this year’s picture-taking happens at the back, right near our table. One waiter stands with his arm around the shoulders of Leanna Hart, and the waiter paws them and tries to look like he’s having intercourse with her from behind as his friend’s flash goes off. What the waiters are going to do with these photos is unguessable, but they’re visibly thrilled, and the starlets are patient and obliging with them in the same blank
,,,,,,
Trying to leave after the AAVNAs gala is another slow process, because the broad hallway outside the ballroom is again filled with industry people with Caesar-cameo’d glasses they’ve somehow forgotten to leave at their tables, all standing in clumps and congratulating one another and making plans for various Insider parties later. But the slowest, scariest egressive part is traversing the long glass vestibule to the hotel’s side exit. A mass of fans and Caesars Palace custodians and assorted other civilians are there, who must run this gauntlet nearly single file. It’s late, and everyone’s tired, and this crowd has none of the awestruck reticence of the cabstand’s spectators earlier. Now it’s like every mook has his own special high-volume comment for the passing stars
,,,,,,
“Love you, Brittany!”,,,,,
,,,,,,
“How’d you get that dress on, baby?”,,,,,
,,,,,,
“Look over here!”,,,,,,
,,,,,,
“Does your mother know where you’re at right now?”,,,,,,
,,,,,,
One florid 30ish man holding a plastic cup of beer now reaches out from the crowd and very deliberately pinches the breast of the B-girl walking just in front of us. She slaps his hand away without breaking stride. Because we cannot see her face, we don’t know whether there is any reaction there at all. We have an informed guess, though.,,,,
,,,,,,
Mr. Dick Filth is behind us with one hand on each of yr. corresps.’ shoulders (we’re basically supporting him out). Everyone’s ears are still ringing, and Filth knows enough to almost shout:,,,,,
,,,,,,
“You know,” he says, “we’ve also got the XRCO Awards in February. X-Rated Critics Organization Awards—you get me? They’re not in Vegas," and they’re not rigged. And yet they manage to be just as ridiculous.”""",,,

Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games
You don’t cry, you don’t care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?

Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

Time slows down; I wish you’d stay
Pass me by in crowded, dark hallways

I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

I heard you say you needed me now
What’s the problem? I can’t see
You destroyed me, I won’t fall apart again
I’m not falling apart
Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?

Now I can’t walk, I can’t talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I’m stuck living out that night again
I’m not falling apart

I'll know it when I see you
Until then, I'll hide in my bedroom
Staying up all night just to write
A love song for no one

Katie, don't cry, I know
You're trying your hardest
And the hardest part is
Letting go of the nights we shared
Ocala is calling
And you know it's haunting
But compared to your eyes
Nothing shines quite as bright
And when we look to the sky
It's not mine, but I want it so

[Chorus (Derek Sanders and (Jake Bundrick))]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
(I know he's there and)
You're probably hanging out and making eyes
(While across the room he stares)
I'll bet he gets the nerve to walk the floor
And ask my girl to dance
And she'll say yes

Because these words were never easier
For me to say or her to second guess
But I guess
That I can live without you but
Without you I'll be miserable at best

[Verse 2 (Derek Sanders)]
You're all that I hoped I'd find
In every single way
And everything I would give
Is everything you couldn't take
Cause nothing feels like home
You're a thousand miles away
And the hardest part of living
Is just taking breaths to stay
Cause I know I'm good for something
I just haven't found it yet
But I need it, so

[Chorus (Jake Bundrick and (Derek Sanders))]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight
(I know he's there and)

And she'll say yes

But I guess

Without you I'll be miserable at best

[Verse 3 (Jake Bundrick)]
And this will be the first time in a week
That I'll talk to you and I can't speak
It's been three whole days since I've had sleep
Cause I dream of his lips on your cheek
And I got the point that I should leave you alone
But we both know that I'm not that strong and
I miss the lips that made me fly, so

[Chorus (Derek Sanders and (Jake Bundrick))]
Let's not pretend like you're alone tonight

They rescued everyone
They lifted up the sun

The process had begun
A million came from one

The trapdoor came undone
Above our heads it swung
The privilege had been won

Heard louder than a gun
The sound they made was love"

How money makes a man grow

If you get enough fame
You live over the rainbow, over the rainbow

But the people on the street
Out on buses or on feet
We all got the same blood flow
Oh in society every dollar got a deed
We all need a place that we can go
And feel over the rainbow

Sometimes we forget what we got
Who we are or who we are not
I think we got a chance to make it right
Keep it loose, keep it tight, keep it tight

I'm in love with a girl who's in love with the world
Though I cant help but follow
Though I know someday she is bound to go away
And stay over the rainbow
Got to learn how to let her go
Over the rainbow

We saw the lion and the kangaroo take her
Down to the river where they caught a wild alligator

It caused a mudslide on the banks of the operator
Civil war skeletons in their graves
They came up clapping in the spirit of the aviator

The sound of the engines and the smell of the grain
We go riding on the abolition grain train

But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator

Chickenmobile with your rooster tail
I had my fill and I know how bad it feels

This is the story of a girl
Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

[Verse 1]
How many days in a year?
She woke up with hope, but she only found tears
And I can be so insincere
Making her promises never for real
As long as she stands there waiting
Wearing the holes in the soles of her shoes
How many days disappear?
When you look in the mirror
So how do you choose?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
You never seem to run out of things to say

Who cried a river and drowned the whole world
And while she looks so sad in photographs
I absolutely love her
When she smiles

Now how many lovers would stay
Just to put up with this every day and all day?
Now how did we wind up this way
Watching our mouths for the words that we say?
As long as we stand here waiting
Wearing the clothes or the soles that we choose
Now how do we get there today
When we're walking too far for the price of our shoes?

Your clothes never wear as well the next day
And your hair never falls in quite the same way
But you never seem to run out of things to say

And while she looks so sad and lonely there
I absolutely love her

Out of macaroni pieces
And it did our thinking while we lived our lives
It counted up our feelings
And divided them up even
And it called our calculation perfect love

So we made the hard decision
And we each made an incision
Past our muscles and our bones
Saw our hearts were little stones
Pulled them out, they weren't beating
And we weren't even bleeding
As we lay them on our granite counter top

We beat them up against each other
We beat them up against each other
We struck them hard against each other

And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

[Verse 2]
Starry, starry night
Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

[Chorus]
Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

[Bridge]
For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you

[Verse 3]
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn; a bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

[Outro]
Now I think I know
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they're not listening still
Perhaps they never will"
1112,113,Not Over You,Gavin DeGraw,Sweeter,5/17/2011,"[Verse 1]
Dreams: that's where I have to go
To see your beautiful face anymore
I stare at a picture of you and listen to the radio
Hope, hope there's a conversation
We both admit we had it good
But until then it's alienation, I know
That much is understood
And I realize

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind
(You're not on my mind, you're not on my mind)
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you
Not over you (not over you)

[Verse 2]
Damn, damn girl you do it well
And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell
But still you're magnificent
I, I'm a boomerang, doesn't matter how you throw me
I turn around and I'm back in the game
Even better than the old me (Old me)
But I'm not even close without you

[Chorus]
If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two
And finally I'm forced to face the truth
No matter what I say, I'm not over you

[Bridge]
And if I had the chance to renew
You know there isn't a thing I wouldn't do
I could get back on the right track
But only if you'd be convinced
So until then...

If you ask me how I'm doing
I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

I set out on a narrow way many years ago
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road
But I got lost a time or two
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you
(Yes, he did)

[Verse 2]
I think about the years I spent just passing through
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
But you just smile and take my hand
You've been there, you understand
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true

[Chorus]
Every long lost dream led me to where you are
Others who broke my heart, they were like Northern stars
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms
This much I know is true
That God bless the broken road that led me straight to you

Into my lover's arms

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be
Everybody's searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfilled my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

[Chorus]
Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I was just calling to see how you were doing
You sounded really uptight last night
It made me a little nervous, and a l... and... well... it made me nervous, it sounded like you were nervous, too
I just wanted to make sure you were really okay
And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication
You know I love you, and...
Take care, honey
I know you're under a lot of pressure
See ya. Bye bye”)

[Verse 1]
I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head
They crawl in like a cockroach, leaving babies in my bed
Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?
It is I that wanted space

I’m sober now for 3 whole months
It’s one accomplishment that you helped me with
The one thing that always tore us apart is the one thing I won’t touch again
In a sick way, I want to thank you for holding my head up late at night
While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take
So I’ll drive so fucking far away that I never cross your mind
And do whatever it takes in your heart to leave me behind

Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made
And like a baby boy, I never was a man
Until I saw your blue eyes cry and I held your face in my hand
And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be
And then she whispered “How can you do this to me?”

[Bridge]
Let me light up the sky just for you tonight
Let me help you fly 'cause you won't have time
To cover your eyes or get your disguise
They won't ask you why
They'll just watch you die
And it's still so hard to be who you are
So you play this part and the show goes on
But you've come this far with a broken heart
Yeah, you've come this far and you're broken

[Chorus]
Let me light up the sky
Light it up for you
Let me tell you why
I would die for you

Let me light up the sky
Light it up for you
Let me make this mine
I'll ignite for you

Let me light up the sky
Light it up for you
Let me tell you why
I would die for you

[Outro]
And it's still so hard to be who you are
But you've come this far with a broken heart
And it's still so hard to be who you are
But you've come this far and you're broken

Let me light up the sky
Let me light up the sky"

You can run free, I won't hold it against ya
You do your thing, never wanted a future
Fuck if I knew how to put it romantic
Speaking my truth, there's no need to panic

Let's keep it fun
We don't put a label on it
So we can run free, yeah

Rules you don't like, but you still wanna keep 'em
Said you were fine so for whatever reason
Sure we can chill, try and keep it platonic
Now you can't tell if I'm really ironic

From way far across the sea
Came an Eritrean maiden she
Had a one-track mind and eyes for me
Half blinded in a war
With a pale, young Anglican
Who said he'd help her all he can
Showed her Jesus and his little unholy friend
She had no mind to please him
Just say 'ta-ra' and leave him behind

[Verse 2]
A little boy in a stairwell who
Says 'I hate people like you'
I got matchsticks and cable TV
Half of less than 50P
We all clambered over the balcony
Banging on the window, waking Steve
Bringing with the true love his unholy friend
Singing, 'If you really need it
You just won't leave it behind'

[Chorus]
So baby please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
But don't bring that ghost 'round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore
Please kill me
Oh baby don't kill me
Just don't bang on about yesterday
You know I wouldn't know about that anyway

[Verse 3]
Monkey asked to the mouse before
If she loved anybody more than he
Turns you into stone
Now I'm reversing down the lonely street
Cheap hotel where I can meet the past
Pay it off and keep it sweet
(aw) It's sweet and it's nothing, no
It's just like nothing at all

[Verse 4]
You know I've seen you there
How could I help but stare?
It rips the heart out of your baby
I've taken too far too much to see or think or touch what's real
Stranded on this street that paved my only way home
If you really need it all
You just won't leave him behind

[Chorus]
Oh please kill me
Oh no don't kill me
Don't bring that ghost 'round to my door
I don't want to see him anymore
Please kill me
Oh no don't kill me
And don't try joke about yesterday
You know I wouldn't know about that anyway

[Instrumental break]

[Outro]
It's sweet like nothing no
It's sweet like nothing at all
It's sweet like nothing no
It's sweet like nothing at all
It's sweet like nothing no
It's sweet like nothing at all"

You Can't Back Down"
1131,132,Fair,Remy Zero,Villa Elaine,8/25/1998,"[Verse 1]
Hey, are you lonely?
Summer gone so slowly
We found the ground
And that damage was done
It's cold as you fade into the sun
Where'd you go? To me?

But you're alive!
Well, it's only
Fallen frames, they told me
You stand out, it's so loud
And so what if it is?
It's cold as you face into the wind
Where'd it go to? Tonight the sun shall see its light

[Chorus]
So what if you catch me
Where would we land?
In somebody's life
For taking his hands
Sing to me hope as she's thrown on the sand
All of our work is raided again
Where to go?

[Verse 2]
And you were somehow the rain this thing could allow
I tried but it's all wrong
You're so strong
And this life and work
And choice took far too long
Where'd it go? Tonight the sun shall see its light

[Chorus]
So what if you catch me
Where would we land?
In somebody's life
For taking his hands
Sing to me hope as she's thrown on the sand
All of our work is raided again


When I was sure you'd follow through
My world was turned to blue (so thin)
When you'd hide your songs would die
So I'd hide yours with mine
And all my words were bound to fail
I know you won't fail
See, I can tell"

(One, two, three)

[Verse 1]
You've been alone
You've been afraid
I've been a fool in so many ways
But I would change my life if you thought you might try to love me
So please give me another chance to write you another song And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

[Verse 2]
I'm not a saint
I'm just a man who had heaven and Earth in the palm of his hand
But I threw it away
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness
And if you could just please give me another chance to write you another song
And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

[Verse 3]
Little girl, you're all I've got
Don't you leave me standing here once again
'Cause I'll give you my life
Yes, I would, if you would let me try to love you
So please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Bridge]
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

[Chorus]
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2am and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

And that's the way I loved you oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much

Running a thousand miles just to get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart

Misty sorrow swoop unbound
Whisper you mean it, say you'll stay
Hold my heart till brighter days

Now I am searching and I'll do it alone

But I need sorrow, baby, like sorrow is the drug
So will I ever find that place they call 'Good Love'?

[Chorus]
Good love
Past it last night in a dream
Good love
And my heart caught fire

[Verse 3]
I drove past true love once, in a dream
Like a house that caught fire, it burned and flamed
And the magician disappeared as quickly as he came
And with a sound like white magic caught in a black car's blazing trail

[Bridge]
The house set fire to my heart
Like an inferno we shone and raged
I'd swallowed the sun in your form
I woke up and you were crying
I woke up and you were saying

Good love
Past it last night in a dream
Was that 'Good Love'?
Cause my heart caught fire (went up in flames)

Past it last night in a dream

Get up in the morning
I can't keep it in
I'm falling all over myself
And I could jump out of my skin
Wanna break the door down
Just to greet the day
'Cause there ain't nothing that's more certain
To keep my blues away

And I say
(La la, hey hey)
And I say
(La la, hey hey)

And it can settle the sadness
And the voices in my head
When I'm in the glow of the warmth you throw
I can put all that to bed

(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
In your light, just when I'm in your light
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)
And I won't get by if you take that light away
(In your light, just when I'm in your light)

[Verse 2]
And when you're smiling on me
That is all I need
To put behind me all my worry
And life's complexities
It may be only a moment
But the world just falls away
And I forget myself
And everything else
That depressed me yesterday

And I can sing
(La la, hey hey)
Yeah I sing
(La la, hey hey)

In a hotel room waiting for you
We're gonna make it tonight, yeah, something in the air
Tells me the time is right, so we better get on

DJ, play a song for the lovers, tonight
Please, play a song for the lovers, tonight

Don't wanna wait, Lord, I've been waiting all my life
But I'm too late again, I know, but I was scared
Can't you see, oh, I'm moving like a train into some foreign land
I ain't got a ticket for this ride but I will

Oh, to a song for my lovers, tonight

DJ, play a song for the lovers, tonight
Please, play a song for the lovers, tonight

I'm alone in a room and I'm waiting for love
I don't know when this dreams gonna stop
But I tell you friend, I don't wanna get up

We’ll have Satanic Christmas Eve
And play piano in the Chateau lobby

It’s my first time
I’ve got you inside
People are boring
But you’re something else completely
Damn, let’s take our chances

I wanna take you in the kitchen
Lift up your wedding dress someone was probably murdered in
So bourgeoisie to keep waiting
Dating for twenty years just feels pretty civilian

Ever thought that once in my whole life
You are my first time
People are boring
But you’re something else I can’t explain
Here take my last name

You left a note in your perfect script:
""Stay as long as you want,"" and I haven’t left your bed since

I haven’t hated
All the same things as somebody else
Since I remember
What’s going on for, uh, what are you doing with your whole life?
How about forever?"

As I whisper the joy of this pain

You've done it all

And the world we know disappear

All we have is this night to get through
With a twist of your smile your own way

And how this kiss will be wonderfully vain
I swear I'll melt if you touch me at all
But then I'll ask you to do it again and again

Crawl across toward your window
I'm calling softly from the street
Always a lonely widow
Half awake and sleeping on my feet
I'm of age but have no children
No quarter phone booth calls to home
Just late night television
Inside my bedroom all alone

[Verse 2]
There is no use in waiting
Offer up your steps so I can climb
Show me all your figure paintings
Etched in the middle of the night
Let me stretch upon your carpet
Let me hear the rain tap on your street
Knowing I am safe on the inside
Blankets wrapped and drifting off to sleep"

Sunk inside our blankets
Sprawled across the bed
And we were dreaming

There are moments when
When I know it ends
The world revolves around us
And we're keeping it
Keep it all going
This delicate balance
Vulnerable, all-knowing

You would kill for this
Just a little bit
Just a little bit
You would

Sing like you think no one's listening
You would kill for this
Just a little bit

You would, you would

Sing me something soft
Sad and delicate
Or loud and out of key
Sing me anything

Done with what we've lost
Our whole lives laid out
Right in front of us

Sing like you think no one's listening

It's easy to get right next to you
I say, ""Baby, scoot over, please""
And then she's right there next to me
I need you here with me

Is suddenly tasteless
I know I'm alone now
I know what it tastes like

So break me to small parts
Let go in small doses
But spare some for spare parts
There might be some good ones

Like you might make a dollar
I'm inside your mouth now
Behind your tonsils
Peeking over your molars

You're talking to her now
You've eaten something minty
And you're making that face that I like
When you're going in, in for the kill, kill
For the killer kiss, kiss for the kiss, kiss

I need your money
It'll help me, I need your car, and I need your love
I need your money
It'll help me, I need your car, and I need your love
So won't you help a brother out?
Won't you help a brother out?
Won't you help a brother out, out, out, out, out?

Watching the windows close?
I've not seen you lately
On the street, by the beach
Or places we used to go

I've a picture of you
On our favorite day by the seaside
There's a bird stealing bread
That I brought out from under my nose

Tell me baby, tell me
Does his company make
Light of a rainy day?
How I've missed you lately
And the way we would speak
And all that we wouldn't say

Do his hands in your hair
Feel a lot like a thing you believe in
Or a bit like a bird stealing bread
Out from under your nose

Tell me baby tell me
Do you carry the words
Around like a key or change?
I've been thinking lately
Of a night on the stoop
And all that we wouldn't say

If I see you again
On the street, by the beach
In the evening
Will you fly like a bird stealing bread

We are lovers through and through
And though we made it through the storm
I really want you to realize, I really want to put you on
I’ve been searching for someone to satisfy my every need
Won’t you be my inspiration?
Be the real love that I need

[Chorus]
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love

[Verse 2]
Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I’m not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

Real love, I’m searching for a real love
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love
I got to have a real love

I thought that you were the answer to the question in my mind
But it seems that I was wrong, if I stay strong, maybe I’ll find
A real love

[Verse 3]
So I’ve tried my best and prayed to God he’ll send me someone real
To caress me and to guide me towards a love my heart can feel
Now I know I can be faithful, I can be your all and all
Ill give you good lovin' through the summertime, winter, spring and fall

Real love, I’m searching for a real love (Real love, real love)
Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love

Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love

See, I'm searching for a real love and I don't know where to go
(Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
Been around the world and high and low and still I never know
(Someone to set my heart free
Real love, I’m searching for a real love)
How it feels to have a real love cause it seems it's not around
Gotta end it in this way 'cause it seems he can't be found

Please, remember me happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin, the time when
We counted every black car passing
Your house beneath the hill
And up until someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention

[Verse 2]
But please, remember me fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say
That the pearly gates
Had some eloquent graffiti
Like ""We'll meet again"" and ""Fuck the man""
And ""Tell my mother not to worry""
And angels with their great handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry

[Verse 3]
And please, remember me that Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white
By midnight, we'd forgotten one another
And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city

[Verse 4]
So please, remember me mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Calling passers-by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour
Gleam and resonate, just like the gates
Around the holy kingdom
With words like ""Lost and found"" and ""Don't look down""
And ""Someone save temptation""

[Verse 5]
And please, remember me as in the dream
We had as rug-burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies
That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior

[Verse 6]
But please, remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above their running
In circles around the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright, on cinder gray, in spray paint
""Who the hell can see forever?""

[Verse 7]
And please, remember me seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turned from me
And said, ""The trapeze act was wonderful
But never meant to last"", the clown that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger

[Verse 8]
So please, remember me finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the pearly gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing
Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissing on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around a frightened trapeze swinger"

I will twist the knife and bleed my aching heart
And tear it apart

I will lie for you
Beg and steal for you
I will crawl on hands and knees until you see
You're just like me

Violate all the love that I'm missing
Blow away all the pain that I'm living
You will believe in me
And I can never be ignored

I would kill for you
I would steal for you
I'd do time for you
I will wait for you
I'd make room for you
I'd sail ships for you
To be close to you
To be a part of you
Cause I believe in you
I believe in you
I would die for you"

That when she pulls me by the hair
She hasn't much to hold onto
She keeping count on her hand one, two, three days
That I been sleeping on my side

I finished kissing my death
So now I head back up the steps
Thinking about where I've been -
I mean the sun was never like this
I wanna feel with the season
I guess it makes sense
Cause my life's become as vapid as
A night out in Los Angeles
And I just want to stay in bed

[Pre-Chorus]
And hold you like I used to
You know that I am home
So darling if you love me
Would you let me know?

[Chorus]
Or go on, go on, go on
If you were thinking that the worst is yet to come
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?
For once, for once, for once
I get the feeling that I'm right where I belong
Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?

[Verse 2]
She got enough on her mind
That she feel no sorrow
I let my fate fill the air
So now she rollin down the window
Never been one to hold on
But I need a last breath
So I ask if she remembers when
She used to come and visit me
We were fools to think that nothing could go wrong

Go on, go on, go on

Why am I the one always packing up my stuff?

And stay awake through summer like we own the heat

To let yourself lose yourself

You'll be coming clean tonight

Call me your valentine, call me once tonight
And I will then say it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them

They went back on us

I could know him to come over when
It's the thought that emerges
(Take back couldn't step it up)
I could never love, your eyes have changed

Bury your head
Has the child smashed you down
And the psalms will never call me again

I'll sleep tonight

And I will then say it's okay

The things you said, I'm rehearsing them

They will be the ones to see him come
Is this what you call love?

They stole my lies
You write it all
They wandered around and 'round my mouth
They stole my lies
You write it all
Stole it all
They have been the ones to see enough

1195,196,Accidental Babies,Damien Rice,9,11/3/2006,"Well, I held you like a lover
Happy hands and your elbow
In the appropriate place

And we ignored our others
Happy plans, for that delicate look
Upon your face

Our bodies moved and hardened
Hurting parts of your garden
With no room for a pardon
In a place where no one knows
What we have done

Do you come
Together ever with him?
And is he dark enough
Enough to see your light?
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?

Well, you held me like a lover
Sweaty hands, and my foot
In the appropriate place

And we use cushions to cover
Happy glands in the mild issue
Of our disgrace

Our minds pressed and guarded
While our flesh disregarded
The lack of space for the light-hearted
In the boom that beats our drum

I know I make you cry
And I know sometimes you wanna die
But do you really feel alive without me?
If so, be free
If not, leave him for me
Before one of us has
Accidental babies
For we are in love

Do you come
Together ever with him
Is he dark enough
Enough to see your light
Do you brush your teeth before you kiss
Do you miss my smell
And is he bold enough to take you on
Do you feel like you belong
And does he drive you wild
Or just mildly free
What about me
What about me"

It is so much too late
To turn away

Disappointments in so many things

When your gambling cards on love you play

I'd rather be in hell

Than in cool Heaven

Before the day is gone
But oh the light shines brighter
On a peaceful day

Stranger blue, leave us alone
We don't want to deal with you
We'll shed our stains showering
In the room that makes the rain

All alone with you
Makes the butterflies in me arise
Slowly we make love and the Earth rotates
To our dictates, slowly we make love

Still is the life
Of your room when you're not inside

Tell the sweetest story line
Your tears on these sheets
And your footsteps are down the hall
So tell me what I did
I can't find where the moment went wrong at all

You can be mad in the morning

Just don't leave me alone here

You know you're not a quick forgive
And I won't sleep through this
I survive on the breath you are finished with

Just don't leave me alone here
It's cold, baby

If I'm your boy
Let's take a shortcut we remember
And we'll enjoy
Picking apples in late September like
We've done for years
Then we'll take a long walk
Through the cornfield
And I'll kiss you
Between the ears
If you're my girl
Swirl me around your room with feeling
And as we twirl
The glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us
As love sweeps over the room
Because we tend to make
Each other blush

For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas

Worse when I am sleeping

And get to church cause you're a good girl

Leaves us both up here forever

I walked by your apartment twice today
While you were gone at work
And all the colors got so down
It's not as cold out here
But come quick, I am losing feeling

Kill the messenger
I swear it's not me
It's just someone I used to know
And get to church cause you're a good girl
And I never told you that
And all I need from you
Could be the thing that
Leaves us both up here forever
I'm gonna send a little rain your way
I'm gonna send a little rain, send a little rain

I'm gonna send a little rain to pour down on you
Rain that makes the flowers bloom
Rain to leave you all alone
That keeps eyelashes falling
And wishes washed away

Kill the messenger
I swear it's not me
It's just someone I used to know
And get to church cause you're a good girl
And I never told you that
And all I need from you
Could be the thing that
Leaves us both up here forever
I'm gonna send a little rain your way
I'm gonna send a little rain...
I'm gonna send a little rain your way"

Got some hearts that I’ll be breakin

Up where everyone can see

I know I spend magic reel it out
Try to hold a light to me

Got my mind made up
Got my mind made up

Ooh oh look so pretty, now you’re just so sweet

Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place

You wanted me to write you letters, but I'd rather lose your address
And forget that we'd ever met and what did or did not occur
Sitting in the station, it's all a blur
Of dancehall hips, pretentious quips
A boxer's bob and weave

And here's the kicker of this whole shebang
You're in debt and completely fooled
That you can look into the mirror and objectively rank your wounds
Sewing circles are not solely based in trades of cloth
There's spinsters all around here taking notes, reporting on us

As information travels faster in the modern age, in the modern age
As our days are crawling by so slowly
Information travels faster in the modern age, in the modern age
As our days are crawling by so slowly"

For all of the loved ones gone
Forever's not so long

And in your soul
They poked a million holes
But you never let them show
Come on, it's time to go

And you already know
Yeah, you already know how this will end

Now you've seen his face
And you know there's a place in the sun
For all that you've done
For you and your children

Just ask and you'll receive
Beyond your wildest dreams

Half as tight as both eyes closed

She went walking where the cedars line the road
Her blouse on the ground
Where the dogs were hungry, roaming

Saying, ""wait, we swear
We'll love you more and wholly
Jezebel, it's we, we that you are for
Only""

Who's seen Jezebel?
She was born to be the woman we could blame
Make me a beast half as brave
I'd be the same

Who's seen Jezebel?
She was gone before I ever got to say
""Lay here my love
You're the only shape I'll pray to, Jezebel""

Who's seen Jezebel?
Will the mountain last as long as I can wait
Wait like the dawn
How it aches to meet the day

Who's seen Jezebel?
She was certainly the spark for all I've done
The window was wide
She could see the dogs come running

Saying, ""wait, we swear
We'll love you more and wholly

Sing silent poetry

The tree said
I wish i could be
A different kind of tree
The cat wished that it was a bee
The turtle wished that it could fly
Really high into the sky
Over rooftops and then dive
Deep into the sea

And in the sea there is a fish
A fish that has a secret wish
A wish to be a big cactus
With a pink flower on it
And in the sea there is a fish
A fish that has a secret wish
A wish to be a big cactus
With a pink flower on it

And the flower
Would be its offering
Of love to the desert
And the desert
So dry and lonely
That the creatures all
Appreciate the effort

Et le jackalope a dit
Je voudrais être un yèti
Pour voler dans la nuit
Et m'en aller loin d'ici
Mais le yèti a dit
Je voudrais être un monstre marin
Pour pouvoir rentrer dans la mer
De tous les requins

And the rattlesnake said
I wish i had hands so
I could hug you like a man
And then the cactus said
Don't you understand
My skin is covered
With sharp spikes
That'll stab you
Like a thousand knives
A hug would be nice
But hug my flower
With your eyes

[Chorus]

And in the sea there is a fish
A fish that has a secret wish
A wish to be a big cactus
With a pink flower on it
And in the sea there is a fish
A fish that has a secret wish
A wish to be a big cactus
With a pink flower on it

And the flower
Would be its offering
Of love to the desert
And the desert
So dry and lonely
That the creatures all
Appreciate the effort"

He bought a little 2 bedroom house on Maple Street
Where she blessed him with six more mouths to feed
Yeah that's crazy

Just ask him how he did it; he'll say pull up a seat
It'll only take a minute, to tell you everything

Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense
Never let your prayin' knees get lazy
And love like crazy

They called him crazy when he quit his job
Said them home computers, boy they'll never take off
He sold his one man shop to Microsoft
They paid like crazy

Just ask him how he made it, he'll tell you faith and sweat
And the heart of a faithful woman, Who never let him forget

Be a best friend, tell the truth, and overuse I love you
Go to work, do your best, don't outsmart your common sense

Every morning 'fore the sun comes up
She bring my coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

When I'm in trouble and I have no friends
I know she'll go with me until the end
Everybody asks me how I know
I smile at them and say she told me so
That's why I know, oh, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
I hear her on my door

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Now if I call her on the telephone
And tell her that I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four

In the evening when the sun goes down
When there is nobody else around
She kisses me and she hold me tight
And tell me ""Daddy, everything's all right""
That's why I know, yes, I know
Hallelujah, I just love her so

Oh, hallelujah
Don't you know I just love her so

While you and me we hold and lean
Onto bodies slick and charged

Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Oh dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the wedding now, oh dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

1260,261,Mad About You,Sting,The Best Of,,"A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And though a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you

And from the dark secluded valleys
I heard the ancient songs of sadness
But every step I thought of you
Every footstep only you
And every star a grain of sand
The leavings of a dried up ocean
Tell me, how much longer?
How much longer?

They say a city in the desert lies
The vanity of an ancient king
But the city lies in broken pieces
Where the wind howls and the vultures sing
These are the works of man
This is the sum of our ambition
It would make a prison of my life
If you became another's wife
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you

And I have never in my life
Felt more alone than I do now
Although I claim dominions over all I see
It means nothing to me
There are no victories
In all our histories, without love

A stone's throw from Jerusalem
I walked a lonely mile in the moonlight
And through a million stars were shining
My heart was lost on a distant planet
That whirls around the April moon
Whirling in an arc of sadness
I'm lost without you
I'm lost without you

And though you hold the keys to ruin
Of everything I see
With every prison blown to dust
My enemies walk free
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand
And fall into the sea
I'm mad about you
I'm mad about you"

I was anxious
It's better just to stay in bed
Didn't want to fail myself again

Running through all the options
And the endings
Were rolling out in front of me
But I couldn't choose a thread to begin

And I could not love
Cause I could not love myself
Never good enough, no
That was all I'd tell myself
And I was not well
But I could not help myself
I was giving up on living

In the morning
You were leaving
Travelling south again
And you said you were not unprepared

And all the dead ends
And disappointments
Were fading from your memory
Ready for that lonely life to end

And you gave me love
When I could not love myself
And you made me turn
From the way I saw myself
And you're patient, love
And you help me help myself
And you save me
And you save me
Yeah you save me"

And the river's cracked and cold
See the sky is no man's land
A darkened plume to stay
Hope here needs a humble hand
Not a fox found in your place

And no man is an island, oh this I know
But can't you see, oh?
Maybe you were the ocean, when I was just a stone

That we are to hold
Comfort came against my will
And every story must grow old
Still I'll be a traveler
A gypsy's reins to face
But the road is wearier
With that fool found in your place

On backroads at night

And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

I hope you think of me

I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

1283,284,Mirrorball,Elbow,The Seldom Seen Kid,4/22/2008,"I plant the kind of kiss
That wouldn't wake a baby
On the self-same face
That wouldn't let me sleep

And the street is singing with my feet
And dawn gives me a shadow I know to be taller
All down to you dear
Everything has changed

My sorry name has made it to graffiti
I was looking for someone to complete me
Not anymore dear
Everything has changed

You make the moon our mirrorball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens, violins
Everything has changed

[Chorus]
So lift off love
Lift off love

And we took the town to town last night
We kissed like we invented it
And now I know what every step is for
To lead me to your door
Know that while you sleep
Everything has changed

You make the moon our mirrorball
The street's an empty stage
The city's sirens, violins
Everything has changed
Everything has changed
Everything has changed

So lift off love
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)

Lift off love
(All down to you dear)
Lift off love
(All down to you dear)

Lift off love

Lift off love

This may be the last thing that I write for long
Can you hear me smiling when I sing this song, for you
And only you?
As I leave, will you be someone to say good-bye?
As I leave, will you be someone to wipe your eye?
My foot is out the door, and you can't stop me now

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanted the best, it wasn't me, will you give it back?
Now I'll take the lead, when there's no more room to make it grow
I'll see you again, you'll pretend you're naive, is this what you want?
Is this what you need, how you end up let me know

[Chorus]
As I go, remember all the simple things you know
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope, that you will miss me when I'm gone
This is the last song

[Verse 2]
The hearts start breaking as the year is gone
The dream's beginning and the time rolls on
It seems so surreal, now I sing it
Somehow I knew that it would be this way
Somehow I knew that it would slowly fade
Now I am gone, just try and stop me now

[Pre-Chorus]
You wanted the best, it wasn't me, will you give it back?
Now I'll take the lead, when there's no more room to make it grow
I'll see you again, you'll pretend you're naive, is this what you want?
Is this what you need, how you end up let me know

As I go, remember all the simple things you know
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope, that you will miss me when I'm gone
This is the last song

And will you need me now, you'll find a way somehow
You want it too, I want it too

As I go, remember all the simple things you know
My mind is just a crutch and I still hope, that you will miss me when I'm gone

Since you blew your last chance when you played me

You'll have to cry me out

The tears that will fall mean nothing at all
It's time to get over yourself

Baby, you ain't all that
Baby, there's no way back
You can keep talkin'
But baby, I'm walkin' away

When I found out
How you messed me about, I was broken
Back then I believed you
Now I don't need ya no more

Proves you weren't alone, she was with you, yeah
Now I couldn't care about who, what or where

So quite another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale another wasted breath
Again it goes unnoticed

[Chorus]
Please, tell me you're just feeling tired
‘Cause if it's more than that, I feel that I might break
Out of touch, out of time
Please, send me anything but signals that are mixed
‘Cause I can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?

Close lipped, another good night kiss
Is robbed of all its passion
Your grip another time is slack
It leaves me feeling empty

[Chorus]
Please, tell me you're just feeling tired
‘Cause if it's more than that, I feel that I might break
Out of touch, out of time
Please, send me anything but signals that are mixed
‘Cause I can't read your rolling eyes
Out of touch, are we out of time?

I’ll wait until tomorrow
Maybe you'll feel better then
Maybe we'll be better then
So what's another day
When I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you?
This mood of yours is temporary
It seems worth the wait to see you smile again
Out of the corner of your eye
Won't be the only way you'll look at me then

So quite another wasted night
The television steals the conversation
Exhale another wasted breath
Again it goes unnoticed"

You say you'll provide the birdbath
If I provide the skin
And bathing in the moonlight
I'm to tremble like a kitten

If blue eyed babes raised as Hitler's little brides and sons
They got angelic tendencies
Like some boys tend to act like queens
If every angel's terrible
Then why do you watch her sleep?
Love to hear her sing and wear purple eyes like rings
And the flowers have no scent
And the child's been miscarried

If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them?
If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them?
If every angel's terrible
Then why do you welcome them?
You say you'll provide the birdbath
If I provide the skin
And bathing in the moonlight
I'm to tremble like a kitten

Oh, every angel's terrible
Said Freud and Rilke all the same
Rimbaud never paid them no mind
But Jimmy Morrison had his elevators
His elevators, he had his elevator angels

If every angel's terrible
Why do you hide inside her?
Like a child in a skirt
The supermarket's loud and bright
Boy, don't she feel warm tonight
Boy, don't she feel warm tonight
Boy, don't she feel warm tonight

You saw me too
I laughed, 'cause I was completely trashed
And I watched your ugly girlfriend sneer across the room
As if I really care that she's here with you
All I know is you're my object of affection
My drug of choice, my sick obsession, oh

For me to play my evil girly games with all their minds

I can charm the pants of anyone else but you

The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No no, no, no

Say something loving
I just don't remember the thrill of affection
I just don't remember
Say something loving
I need a reminder, the feeling's escaped me

[Verse 1: Romy Madley Croft]
I went looking for it
Could have been anyone's kiss
Throwing my arms at no one
When I gave up, I found love

[Verse 2: Oliver Sim]
The thought flows through my mind
And it's growing all the time
I do myself a disservice
To feel this weak, to be this nervous

[Chorus 2: Oliver Sim & Romy Madley Croft]
You say something loving
It's so overwhelming, the thrill of affection
Feels so unfamiliar
You say something loving
Without hesitation it hits me, hits me
It feels so unfamiliar

[Post-Chorus: Alessi Brothers]
Before it slips away

[Verse 3: Romy Madley Croft]
Your touch stays on my skin
I feel it start sinking in
Here come my insecurities
I almost expect you to leave

Were you really looking for me?
Try your best to reassure me
I wasn't patient to meet you
Am I too needy, am I too eager?

I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know what this is, but it doesn't feel wrong

Did you hear me say it?
Say it
Did you hear me say?

I can't hold it inside, the thrill of affection
Is only getting stronger
I say something loving
All my hesitations are fading, fading
I feel it taking over

Cigarettes and chocolate milk
These are just a couple of my cravings
Everything it seems I like's a little bit stronger
A little bit thicker, a little bit harmful for me

If I should buy jellybeans
Have to eat them all in just one sitting
Everything it seems I like's a little bit sweeter
A little bit fatter, a little bit harmful for me

[Verse 3]
And then there's those other things
Which for several reasons we won't mention
Everything about 'em is a little bit stranger
A little bit harder, a little bit deadly

It isn't very smart
Tends to make one part
So brokenhearted

Sitting here remembering me
Always been a shoe made for the city
Go ahead accuse me of just singing about places
Where scrappy boys faces have general run of the town

[Verse 5]
Playing with prodigal sons
Takes a lot of sentimental valiums
Can't expect the world to be your Raggedy Andy
While running on empty, you little old doll with a frown

[Verse 6]
You got to keep in the game
Retaining mystique while facing forward
I suggest a reading of A Lesson in Tightropes
Or Surfing Your High hopes, or Adios Kansas

It isn't very smart
Tends to make one part
So brokenhearted

Still there's not a show on my back
Holes or a friendly intervention

You said, ""Come on, babe, it'll be alright""
I must've been a fool to the bitter end
Now I hold on to hope that I'll have you back again

I'd bargain and I'd fight
But there's another world you're livin' in tonight

[Chorus]
Don't want your picture on my cell phone
I want you here with me
I don't want your memory in my head, no
I want you here with me

Well, I saw you in a restaurant the other day
And instead of walkin' towards you, I ran away (ran away)
I keep on waitin' for you
For you to come around
Come around and say

You must think I'm a fool
So prosaic and awkward and all
Do you think you've got me down?
Do you think I've never been out of this town?

Do I seem too eager to please to you now?
You don't know me at all
I can't turn it on, turn it off like you now
No, I'm not like you

[Verse 2]
Now, now you're here
I bet you're wishing you could disappear
I'm trying to be kind
I get the feeling you're just killing time
You look down at me
Don't you look down at me now
You don't know me at all
A slap in the face, in the face for you now
Just might do now

[Chorus 1]
You're leaving so soon?
Never had a chance to bloom
But you were so quick to change your tune

Don't look back
If I'm a weight around your neck
Cause if you don't need me
I don't need you

If I don't need you

Leaving so soon, soon?
Leaving, leaving so soon?

We live together in a photograph of time
I look into your eyes
And the seas open up to me
I tell you I love you
And I always will
And I know that you can't tell me

So I'm left to pick up
The hints, the little symbols of your devotion
I feel your fists
And I know it's out of love

Straight through my heart
It's out of love

And all the things you used to say
Things you used to do, went right out the door

Oh no more, will you be the one
That's what you tell everyone around you
But you know they've heard it all before

And you can't help who you love
And you find yourself giving it away
When you think you're in love

In your heart is sent from (sent from heaven)

What the fear from what it's been

And everything you used to say
Everything you used to do clear right out the door

And you are the one I've been waiting for today
And here comes the sun, it's been baiting morn' today

Lately I've lost my tongue
Today you found a song
Unknown our love has grown
And I thank God you came along

And you are the one I've been waiting for today
And here comes the sun, it's been baiting morn' today

You looked right through me, there was no one else
I sat beside you and became myself today

Do I have nothing good left to say?
Do I need whiskey to start fueling my complaints?
People love to drink their troubles away
Sometimes I feel that I'd be better off that way

(Chorus)
Cause maybe then I could sleep at night
I wouldn't lie awake until the morning light
This is something that I'll never control
My nerves will be the death of me, I know
I know, I know

(Verse 2)
So here's to living life miserable
And here's to all the lonely stories that I've told
Maybe drinking wine will validate my sorrow
Every man needs a muse and mine could be the bottle

(Chorus)

(Bridge)
Finally, I could hope for a better day
No longer holding on to all the things that cloud my mind
Maybe then the weight of the world wouldn't seem so heavy
But then again I'll probably always feel this way

(Chorus 2)
At least I know I'll never sleep at night. (Sleep at night)
I'll always lie awake until the morning light. (Til the morning light)
This is something that I'll never control
My nerves will be the death of me
My nerves will be the death of me

My nerves will be the death of me, I know"

He's here! He's here!"")

I hear him, before I go to sleep
And focus on the day that's been
I realise he's there
When I turn the light off and turn over
Nobody knows about my man
They think he's lost on some horizon
And suddenly I find myself
Listening to a man I've never known before
Telling me about the sea
All his love, 'til eternity

Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes
He's very understanding
And he's so aware of all my situations
And when I stay up late
He's always waiting, but I feel him hesitate
Oh, I'm so worried about my love
They say, ""No, no, it won't last forever.""
And here I am again, my girl
Wondering what on Earth I'm doing here
Maybe he doesn't love me
I just took a trip on my love for him

Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes
Ooh, he's here again
The man with the child in his eyes"

[Verse 1]
Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take our chance and fly away somewhere alone

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been so long since we took the time
No-one is to blame
I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

[Chorus]
Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

[Verse 2]
Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together, all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been so long since we took the time
No-one is to blame
I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

[Chorus]
Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special

1323,324,The Best Day,Taylor Swift,Fearless,11/11/2008,"[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Chorus]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

[Chorus]
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

[Chorus]
And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today"
1324,325,Enchanted,Taylor Swift,Speak Now,10/25/2010,"[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey""
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

[Breakdown]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Hold me close, sway me more

Bend with me, sway with ease

Stay with me, sway with me

Only you have that magic technique
When we sway I go weak

Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

1328,329,Wrapped Up in Books,Belle and Sebastian,Books,10/6/2003,"It was pretty bright, up on the rainbow bridge tonight
I could see into your window although you’re far away
You were racing in a car
Beside a boy, you just don’t know if he is up for
What you have in mind
If he is up for what you have in mind

Change is on the cards, but this time it will be hard
But I never want to leave you
We’ve never had a fight
You should never split a pole
You should never split at all
I wish I had two paths I could follow
I’d write the ending without any sorrow

I will say a prayer, just while you are sitting there
I will wrap my hands around you
So I know it will be fine

We’ve got a fantasy affair
We didn’t get wet, we didn’t dare
Our aspirations are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks

Summer’s hastening on
I’m trying to get a feeling from
The city but I’ve been unfaithful
I’ve been traveling abroad

We’ve got a fantasy affair
We didn’t get wet, we didn’t dare
But the fantasy remains
You better come back to Earth again
Our aspirations are wrapped up in books
Our inclinations are hidden in looks"

I'm so alive
I'm so enlightened
I can barely survive
A night in my mind
So I've got a plan
I'm going to find out just how boring I am
And have a good time

Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule

[Chorus]
Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been

[Verse 2]
Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't they remind you of just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess

Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool

And talk is the same cheap it's been

I wear a new cologne and
You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
I know what you'll say
This won't last longer than the rest of the day
But you're wrong this time
You're wrong

Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
I'm over the analyzing tonight

Never going to find the perfect rhyme

You need not to cross the sea
You need not to find a cure
For everything that makes you weak

You need not to reach for the stars
When life becomes so dark
And when the wind does blow against the grain
You must follow your heart

You must follow your heart

When all your friends have come and gone
And the sun no longer shines
And the happiness for which you long
Is washed away like an oceans tide

When all the hard times outweigh the good
And all your words are misunderstood
When the day seems lost from the start
You must follow your heart

You must follow your heart

If you feel you've paid the price
And your wounds should cease to heal
And everything you love in life
Spins like a winding wheel

If you should wake to find you're abandoned
And the road you traveled leads to a dead end
When death creeps in to play it's part
You must follow your heart

You must follow your heart"

Sweep up
And then they leave
And you don't hear a single floorboard creak
They're so much stronger than the friends you try to keep by your side

That you would ever feel the same way about me

Am I crazy or falling in love?
Is it real or just another crush?

Are you holding back like the way I do?
Cause I've tried and tried to walk away
But I know this crush ain't going away-ay-ay
Going away-ay-ay

Something that will last, last forever, forever

On the phone pleading, saying

Pull that blanket over your shoulders exposed to the night
And the hunger of those early years will never return
But I don't mind, I don't mind

Slowed down to a crawl
Years of crime and the bread line
Have not at all dimmed your shine

And I dressed her wounds
And how I held her
Beneath the rising moon
And she stood to fly
And she stood to fly away
And she stood to fly
She stood to fly away

And all the stars were crashing 'round
As I laid eyes on what I'd found
My crane wife, my crane wife
My crane wife, my crane wife

[2]

My crane wife arrived at my door in the moonlight
All star bright and tongue-tied I took her in
We were married and bells rang sweet for our wedding
And our bedding was ready when we fell in

Sound the keening bell
And see it's painted red
Soft as fontanelle
The feathers and the thread
And all I ever meant to do was to keep you
My crane wife
My crane wife
My crane wife

We were poorly, our fortunes fading hourly
And how she vowed me, she could bring it back
But I was greedy, I was vain and I forced her to weaving
On cold loom, in a closed room, with down wove

Sound the keening bell
And see it's painted red
Soft as fontanelle
The feathers and the thread
And all I ever meant to do was to keep you
My crane wife
My crane wife

There's a bend in the wind and it rakes at my heart
There is blood in the thread and it rakes at my heart
It rakes at my heart

My crane wife"

And I am still here waiting to see you again
Be with you, my friend
When the moon is gone forever
I hope you're up there somewhere
I'll see you again

Look out across the water
Faces of lonely daughters and mothers who care
But just can't be there
Swear that I will see you someday
I have to find a way to show you I care
Even if you're not there

So I'm following the road to where you are
(Meet you tonight on top of)
The streetlights they will guide me to the stars

Sometimes you don't know what you do
And I need you tonight
I'll fall asleep and it's alright
Close my eyes and I'll be by your side

And we can do anything, we can be anything

The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You told me about your past, thinking your future was me

There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here

Too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

I drove up to the city at night
And found the place where you grew up
And then where you stayed
And then we walked around and stayed up late
Under city lights; and I spent the night
Next to you in the house where you grew up
Next to you, I miraculously woke up
In your parents' house I lied in bed with you

[Chorus]
I went back to feel alone there
I went back to wipe it clean
I took the lights and radio towers out of my dreams

[Verse 2]
And we went all the way up to the small town where I'm from
With foggy air and the wind and the mountain tops
And we clung to rocks and we looked off
You held my hand, you almost got to start feeling me
I finally felt like I was breathing free
And under swaying trees, we fell asleep and had the same dream
The stars were bright, we dream the same every night
On my island home I spent some time with you

[Chorus]
I went back to feel alone there
I went back there by myself
And gave up on everything that we'd felt

[Verse 3]
We found a precious place in the sand
Right out in the wind, and we lied under a blanket
And heard the furious sound
The roar of waves, the pounding surf
Two bodies on the earth
It was intense just getting to be there next to you
And you were trying to get me then
And I was happy to let you in

[Chorus]
I went back and wished I hadn't
I went back and felt regret
I went to the beach and I stared west

[Verse 4]
Every night when the sun went down
In the town where we live, the empty streets were lit up
By reflective light from a distant sun
Bouncing off a glowing ball of rock
We just lied on the roof and watched
The moon, the moon, the blue light of the moon
We didn't talk and silently we both felt powerful
Like the moon, my chest was full
Because we both knew we're just floating in space
Over molten rock, and we felt safe and discovered that our skin is soft
There's nothing left except certain death
And that was comforting at night out under the moon

[Chorus]
I went out last night to forget that
I went out and stared it down
But the moon just stared back at me
And in its light I saw my two feet on the ground"

On top of the family tree

And if he has chosen the point while she is under him
Then leave her coily placed crouched sucking him
For it is I
With her on knee

Spent the weekends sewing the pieces back on

Won't confess all my sins

I always freeze when I'm thinking of words to say
All the things she does
Make it seem like love
If it's just a game (Just a game)
Then I like the way that we play

I need to find my way back to the start

And cut the nooses they tie for our necks

Keep us comatose but audible
And I like it the farther I get out
We pass it off but it's all on us
Only common conversation
It took everything I got

Once said, always said
I will hold the past over your head
I'll speak my mind whenever I feel slighted
I am hellbent on extracting all of my revenge
Take heart, sweetheart, or I will take it from you

Love is always hunted
But your arrows are soaring through my chest
Cause you know you give me something
Yeah you give me exactly what I need
Got my blood pumping
You know you always draw more blood, I bleed

[Chorus]
So please don’t let go, cause you know exactly what we found
So please don’t let go my darling
You keep me locked up underground
It’s gonna be you and me
It’s gonna be everything you’ve ever dreamed
It’s gonna be who and me
It’s gonna be everything and everything, we’re meant to be
We’re meant to be

Where you keep your dollar bills
And you stashed my heart
Somewhere in the dark
Keep it safe I know you will

1404,405,Brand New Day,Sting,Brand New Day,9/1/1999,"[Verse 1]
How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights
How many lies, how many fights
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
""Love is pain,"" I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

[Chorus 1]
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero, sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
Starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across
Started up a brand new day

[Verse 2]
It could happen to you - just like it happened to me
There's simply no immunity - there's no guarantee
I say love's such a force - if you find yourself in it
And sometimes no reflection is there
Baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute

[Chorus 2]
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I’ll sell the stock, we’ll spend all the money
We’re starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, Mac
I begging her to take me back
I’m thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river’s wide, we’ll swim across
Started up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, buddy
Don’t wanna be no fuddy-duddy
Started up a brand new day

I'm the sun and you're the moon

I'm the train and you're the station
I'm a flagpole to your nation - yeah

I’m the present to your future
You’re the wound and I’m the suture
You’re the magnet to my pole

You’re the church and I’m the preacher
You’re the flower, I’m the rain
You’re the tunnel, I’m the train

Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world
Starting up a brand new day

You’re the crop to my rotation
You’re the sum of my equation
I’m the answer to your question
If you follow my suggestion
We can turn this ship around
We’ll go up instead of down
You’re the stair and I’m the handle
You’re the flame and I’m the candle

Stand up all you lovers in the world
Stand up and be counted every boy and every girl
Stand up all you lovers in the world

It's a brand new day
It's a brand new day"

Sing, muse, of the warning by the whistle
On a night so dark in the waning
A dawn obscured by slate sky raining

Five and twenty burglars by the reservoir
A teenage lookout on the signal tower
The mogul's daughter in hogtie
The mogul fingers the wrong guy, all lies

It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect crime
It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect crime

The bagman's quaking at the fingers
The hand-off glance a little lingers
A well-dressed man in the crosshairs
A shot rings out from somewhere upstairs

It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the
Perfect crime
It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the
Perfect crime

It was the perfect crime

It was like a ticker-tape parade
When the plastique on the safe was blown away
And we all gazed from eye to eye
As we mouthed our silent goodbyes

The valley's sleeping like a bastard
It stinks of slumber and disaster
Two words are spoken on the tap wire
The agent's ploy finds a surefire backfire

It was a perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the perfect, the
Perfect crime

Treatin' Diamonds of Atlanta like it's King of Diamonds
Take a flick, I look like Meechy, look like Bleu DaVinci
I treat V Live like it's 07 in Magic City

Then I came, right back on my worst behav'

6 God, selfish with the love, I need all the praise (woo)
They got me feelin' like the one again (woo)

I need a FuelBand just to see how long the run has been

But I do not cry
Countin' the days that pass me by
I've been searchin' deep down in my soul
Words that I'm hearin' are starting to get old
It feels like I'm startin' all over again
The last three years were just pretend
And I said

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved
The one thing that I tried to hold on to

And it seems that I can't live a day without you
Closin' my eyes and you chase my thoughts away
To a place where I am blinded by the light

Goodbye to you
Goodbye to everything I thought I knew
You were the one I loved

While this town is busy sleeping
All the noise has died away
I walk the streets to stop my weeping
Cause she'll never change her ways

[Chorus 1]
Don't fool yourself, she was heartache from the moment that you met her
Ah, my heart feels so still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow
Oh, I think I've forgotten her now

[Verse 2]
Her love is a rose, pale and dying
Dropping her petals in land unknown
All full of wine, the world before her, was sober with no place to go

[Chorus 1]
Don't fool yourself, she was heartache from the moment that you met her
My heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow
She's somewhere out there now

Well my tears falling down as I try to forget
Her love was a joke from the day that we met
All of the words, all of her men
All of my pain when I think back to when
Remember her hair as it shone in the sun
The smell of the bed when I knew what she'd done
Tell yourself over and over you won't ever need[Chorus 2]
Her again

But don't fool yourself
She was heartache from the moment that you met her
Oh, my heart is frozen still as I try to find the will to forget her, somehow

1418,419,Empty,Ray LaMontagne,Till The Sun Turns Black,8/29/2006,"She lifts her skirt up to her knees
Walks through the garden rows with her bare feet, laughing
I never learned to count my blessings
I choose instead to dwell in my disasters
I walk on down the hill
Through grass, grown tall and brown
And still its hard somehow to let go of my pain
On past the busted back of that old and rusted Cadillac
That sinks into this field, collecting rain
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged

And of these cut-throat busted sunsets
These cold and damp white mornings
I have grown weary
If through my cracked and dusted dime-store lips
I spoke these words out loud would no one hear me?
Lay your blouse across the chair
Let fall the flowers from from your hair
And kiss me with that country mouth, so plain
Outside, the rain is tapping on the leaves
To me it sounds like they're applauding us the the quiet love we made
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged

Well I looked my demons in the eyes
Laid bare my chest, said ""Do your best, destroy me
You see, I've been to hell and back so many times
I must admit you kind of bore me.""
There's a lot of things that can kill a man
There's a lot of ways to die
Listen, some already did that walked beside me
There's a lot of things I don't understand
Why so many people lie
Its the hurt I hide that fuels the fire inside me
Will I always feel this way?
So empty, so estranged"

Weavin' its way across the sea
Somewhere from mars
It's down the street we would run
To scratch our names in the path
Young and free in the sun
Wheels upon the tar

Let the funeral start, hear the casket close
Let’s pin split-black ribbon to your overcoat
Well, laughter pours from under doors
In this house, I don’t understand that sound no more
It seems artificial, like a TV set

Well, haligh, haligh, a lie, haligh
This weight it must be satisfied
You offer only one reply
You know not what you do
But you tear and tear your hair from roots
From that same head you have twice removed now
A lock of hair you said would prove
Our love would never die
Well, ha ha ha

I remember everything
The words we spoke on freezing South Street
And all those mornings watching you get ready for school
You combed your hair inside that mirror
The one you painted blue and glued with jewelry tears
Something about those bright colors
Would always make you feel better
But now we speak with ruined tongues
And the words we say aren’t meant for anyone
It’s just a mumbled sentence to a passing acquaintance
But there was once you

You said you hate my suffering
And you understood
And you’d take care of me
You'd always be there
Well where are you now?

But left to hang like yarn and twine
Dangling before my eyes

From that same head you have twice removed now

Our love would never die

And I sing and sing of awful things
The pleasure that my sadness brings
As my fingers press onto the strings
In yet another clumsy chord
Haligh, haligh, an awful lie
This weight will now be satisfied
I'm gonna give you only one reply
I know not who I am

But I talk in the mirror
To the stranger that appears
Our conversations are circles
Always one sided
Nothing is clear

Except we keep coming back
To this meaning that I lack

Now you must live them
Or just not live

Now my love, I'm ready to show

[Chorus]
When I think about it
I know that I was never there or even cared
The more I think about it
The less that I was able to share with you
I try to reach for you, I can almost feel you
You're nearly here
And then you disappear
You disappear, you disappear
You disappear, disappear"

""You've got to get better""
I said, ""it's all in your head""
We could live through these letters
Or forget it all together
See, the months, they don't matter
It's the days I can't take
When the hours move to minutes
And I'm seconds away

[Chorus]
Just ask the question, come untie the knot
Say you won't care
Say you won't care
Retrace the steps, as if we forgot
Say you won't care
Say you won't care
You try to avoid it, but there's not a doubt
And there's one thing I can do nothing about

[Verse 2]
Well, all that we need is just a reaction
It's too much to ask for when there's no attraction anymore
If chasing our dreams is just a distraction
I want to remember when I know that I can't go back

[Chorus]
Just ask the question, come untie the knot
Say you won't care
Say you won't care
Retrace the steps, as if we forgot
Say you won't care
Say you won't care
You try to avoid it, but there's not a doubt
And there's one thing I can do nothing
There's one thing I can do nothing
There's one thing I can do nothing about

Just ask the question, come untie the knot
Say you won't care
Say you won't care
Retrace the steps, as if we forgot

There's one thing I can do nothing

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and

I want out

Welcome back
Winter once again
And put on your warm fuzzy sweater
Because you'll feel much better when
The snowflakes fall
Gently to the ground
The temperature drops
And your shivers freeze all the rivers around
But I keep you warm

If speed's a pro
Inertia must be a con
Because the cold wind blows at precise rates
When I've got my ice skates on
If all the roads
Were paved with ice that wouldn't thaw or crack
I could skate from Maine to Nebraska
Then on to Alaska and back
Because you keep me warm

Peer over the edge
Can you see me?
Rivulets flow from your eyes
Paint runs from your mouth
Like a waterfall
And your lungs crystalize
I'll travel the sub-zero tundra
I'll brave glaciers and frozen lakes
And that's just the tip of the iceberg
I'll do whatever it takes
To change

Farewell powdery paradise
We'd rather skate on the thinnest ice
Fingers failed us before they froze
Frostbite bit down on all our toes

Snow drifts build up and enfold us
As we wait out this winter storm
So we snuggle close in the darkness
And keep each other so warm"

I'm all about you, you're all about me, we're all about each other

You don't have to tell 'cause I know so well, what we are all after?
Likewise if uncertainty puts a spell on me, I have to zoom in your laughter, your laughter
Wednesday morning, we sleep over and we're late again
Let's skip breakfast, we need this precious time just to comprehend

I'll leave before the dawn

But for tonight I'll stay here with you
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you

But when the sun hits your eyes
Through your window
There'll be nothing you can do

What if you could hear this song?
What if I felt like I belong?

I might not be leaving oh so soon
Began the night believing
I loved you in the moonlight

So for tonight I'll stay here with you
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you

But when the sun hits your eyes
Through your window
There'll be nothing you can do

I could've treated you better, better than this
Well I'm gone
This song's your letter
Can't stay in one place

So for tonight I'll stay here with you
Yes for tonight I'll lay here with you

How it truly broke my heart to have to watch her leave
But she was torn between what she wants and what she needs
They say you love someone enough, you gotta set them free
She said that she was born to leave this town behind
Knew the truth but still, she looked me in the eyes and lied
Saying ""It's time to cut the ties, time to say goodbye""
So she left, but she never-never left my, never-never left my mind

If you see Kay, will you tell her that I love her? Oh, yeah
And if you see Kay, let her know I want her back

We will walk in fields of gold

I never made promises lightly

You will be back someday
And this awkward kiss that tells of other people's lips will be of service
To keeping you away

I heard that you were feeling sorry
I heard from someone that you wish you could set things right between us
Well, I guess I should have heard of that from you

That my body froze in bed
If I just listened to it
Right outside the window
There were days when the sun was so cruel
That all the tears turned to dust
And I just knew my eyes were
Drying up forever
I finished crying in the instant that you left
And I can't remember where or when or how
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made

But when you touch me like this
And you hold me like that

That it's all coming back to me

And whenever you tried to hurt me
I just hurt you even worse
And so much deeper
There were hours that just went on for days
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances
That were lost to us forever
But you were history with the slamming of the door
And I made myself so strong again somehow
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then

And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

It will be completely

What I could not before

Whatever you didn't do, what you couldn't say
I am sorry the worst has arrived
For I deserve more
For at least I deserve the respect of a kiss goodbye

Tell me, do you think of me now
As I think of you?
For I could not have shaken
The touch of your breath on my arm

For it has stayed in me as an epithet
I am sorry the worst has arrived
For I'm on the floor
In the room where we made it our last touch of the night

I walked, cause you walked
But I won't probably get very far
Sensation to what you said

I should not be so lost
But I've got nothing left to love

Lover, will you look from me now
I'm already dead
But I've come to explain
Why I left such a mess on the floor

I ran through the night
With a knife in my chest, with the lust of your loveless life

And there's this burning
Like there's always been
I never been so alone
And I've never been so alive

[Verse 2: Stephan Jenkins]
Visions of you on a motorcycle drive by
The cigarette ash flies in your eyes
And you don't mind, you smile
And say the world doesn't fit with you
I don't believe you, you're so serene
Careening through the universe
Your axis on a tilt, you're guiltless and free
I hope you take a piece of me with you
And there's things I'd like to do
That you don't believe in
I would like to build something
But you never see it happen

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
And there's this burning
Like there's always been
I never been so alone
And I've never been so alive

[Guitr Solo: Kevin Cadogan]

[Bridge: Stephan Jenkins]
And there's this burning
There is this burning

[Verse 3: Stephan Jenkins]
Where's the soul I want to know
New York City is evil
The surface is everything but I could never do that
Someone would see through that
And this is our last time
We'll be friends again
I'll get over you, you'll wonder who I am

[Chorus: Stephan Jenkins]
And there's this burning
Like there's always been
I never been so alone
And I've never been so alive

[Verse 4: Stephan Jenkins]
I go home to the coast
It starts to rain I paddle out on the water
Alone
Taste the salt and taste the pain
I'm not thinking of you again
Summer dies and swells rise
The sun goes down in my eyes
See this rolling wave
Darkly coming to take me home

[Outro: Stephan Jenkins]
And I've never been so alone
And I've never been so alive"

Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one

Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Frozen hearts growing colder with time
There's no heat from our mouths
Please take me back to when I was yours

And we were in flames, I needed, I needed you
To run through my veins, like disease, disease
And now we are strange, strangers

(I need you... I need you...)

It's different now, gray faced, eyes burnt out
Flames are gone, my gloves are out
I have a feeling love's gone mad

We're too similar, losing our minds
With cabin fever, shut in confined spaces
Lost in the dark, my heart taken and resting on your heart

And we were in flames, I needed, I needed you
To run through my veins, like disease, disease
And now we are strange, strangers

Wait for me to degrade before
You go killing prey for waste of
Daylight speaks when
Slumber's keeping under the bed
Out of revenge, I'm derailing
My youth has stained our sheets
With some piece of me
With some piece of me

Oh, winter crush all of the things that I once loved
Winter come
Winter crush all of the things that I once had"

Swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?
With it
Don't you blink; you might miss it
See, we got a right to just love it or leave it
You find it and keep it
'Cause it ain't every day you get the chance to say...

[Chorus]
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

[Verse 2]
I'd never seen it
But I found this love, I'm gonna feed it
You better believe
I'm gonna treat it better than anything I've ever had
'Cause you're so damn beautiful
Read it, it's signed and delivered, let's seal it
Boy, we go together like peanuts and Paydays
Marley and reggae
And everybody needs to get a chance to say...

[Chorus]
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun

[Bridge]
Everything is like a white out
'Cause we shika-shika shine down
Even when the, when the light's out, but I can see you glow
Got my head up in the rafters, got me happy ever after
Never felt this way before, ain't felt this way before

I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn't expecting
But who am I to tell fate where it's supposed to go?

[Chorus]
Oh, this is how it starts (This is how it starts)
Lightning strikes the heart (Lightning strikes the heart)
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky (Falling from the sky)
Shining how we want, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts (This is how it starts)
Lightning strikes the heart (Lightning strikes the heart)
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, we could be the stars, falling from the sky
Shining how we want (Shining how we want)
Brighter than the sun

[Bridge]
Brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun

Oh-o, yeah, oh-o

Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts, lightning strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun, brighter than the sun"

Waiting there for him to come back home
Waiting down on the corner

She sits alone by a lamp post
Trying to find a thought that's escaped her mind
She says Dad's the one I love the most
But Stipe's not far behind

[Verse 2]
She never lets me in
Only tell me where's she's been
When she's had too much to drink
I say that I don't care
I just run my hands through her dark hair
Then I pray to God, you gotta help me fly away and just

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, let her be

This morning I woke up alone
Found a note standin' by the phone
Saying maybe, maybe I'll be back some day
I wanted to look for you
You walked in, I didn't know just what I should do
So I sat back down and had a beer and felt sorry for myself
Saying...

Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be, let her be

Let her be, oh

Last night I tried to leave
Cried so much, I could not believe
She was the same girl I fell in love with long ago
She went in the back to get high
I sat down on my couch and cried
Yelling, ""Oh mama, please help me""
Won't you hold my hand and...

[Chorus]
Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me
And if the sun comes up tomorrow
Let her be
Let her cry, if the tears fall down like rain
Let her sing, if it eases all her pain
Let her go, let her walk right out on me

My heart ticks in beat with these kids that I grew up with

1514,515,Prototype,OutKast,Speakerboxxx / The Love Below,3/23/2018,"Yeah I try keep away from the socials
I know the social lies
Move anti
Focus when I vocalise
Countdown when seek beats
The weak know to hide
I can't choose days to show my pride

So it’s fist in the air, when I hold the mic
Rather be the outkast or the prototype
Can't conform to the filters & pose for hype
They teeth from top charts thats an overbite, Like

…Too many celebrities overnight
Insta careers, over in a moments sight
Gassed from number but your followers move like poltergeist
Pointless pursuing images if your soul ain't right

I can't mix with those energies there
Leviate clear from an enemies stare
Next year I’ll be a better me swear
But I'm here with truth I could never be dare

Cause I , level the vessel in me
Boil like kettles, from instrumentals
Little me never picked pettles
But patterned the rules, to rebel

Revel being the bomb
With Jäger & Red Bull
Technique is immortal
But still I never dance with the devil

Settle your decimals
Dependable on other man writing
You don’t need a pen at all
Defeated book a pedicure

…I see the issues then address it like pinafore
Win-doe's opportunities like there’s never bin a door

(Easy x3)

CHORUS

1 flow, 2 flow, 3 flows, fro'z
Only chill by realness kept it fro'z
I tried to share the mic but they fro'z
Big the gyal dem flex with fro'z (x4)

VERSE 2

Yeah they followed with their pen skills
I lead with pencils
Permanent drive, their stuck with rentals
You know that a black queen is essential
Don’t chat about weakest link
When you’re not linked in-
Checked your LinkedIn
Where’s the credentials?

No CV like you're not a Cov residential
Even if I didn’t live in B23
The corrupt still don’t want you to be too free

See the downfall is locked to your mental
I can’t support all the violence they fed you
Can’t support all the standards that tempt you
Never attempted to fit in, just spin riddims to vent to

Cut ties with questioning when
Make moves, not wise to enter the den
Enter with dragons, flagging fire prepared to offended
With a heart full of anger, But mindful of zen

Pre-Chorus

If you can’t take the heat get out the kitchen
If you can’t take the cold adapt your system (x4)

1 flow, 2 flow, 3 flows, fro'z

She left without leaving a number
Said, she needed to clear her mind
He figured she'd gone back to Austin
Cuz she talked about it all the time
It was almost a year
Before she called him up
Three rings and an answering machine
Is what she got

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout the car, I sold it
If this is Tuesday night I'm bowling
If you've got something to sell
You're wasting your time, I'm not buying
If it's anybody else, wait for the tone
You know what to do
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Verse 2]
The telephone fell to the counter
She heard but she couldn't believe
What kind of man would hang on that long
What kind of love that must be
She waited three days
And then she tried again
She didn't know what she'd say
But she heard three rings and then

[Chorus]
If it's Friday night I'm at the ballgame
And first thing Saturday, if it don't rain
I'm headed out to the lake
And I'll be gone, all weekend long
But I'll call you back when I get home
On Sunday afternoon
And P.S. if this is Austin
I still love you

[Bridge]
Well, this time she left her number
But not another word
Then she waited by the phone on Sunday evening
And this is what he heard

[Chorus]
If you're calling 'bout my heart, it's still yours
I should've listened to it a little more
Then it wouldn't have taken me so long
To know where I belong
And by the way, boy
This is no machine you're talking to
Can't you tell, this is Austin
And I still love you
I still love you"

Packed and all eyes turned in
No one to see on the quay no one waving
For me just the shoreline receding
Ticket in my hand, I'm thinking ""wish I didn't hand it in""

Cause who said sailing is fine?
Leaving behind all the faces that I might
Replace if I tried on that long ride
Looking deep inside but I don't want to look so deep inside yet

[Verse 1, Part 2: Jonathan Meiburg]
Sit down, sit down on the prow to wave bye
There might not be another star further on the line
Look out, look out at each town that glides by
And there's another crowd to drown in crying eyes

And see how that light you love now just won't shine
There might just be another star that's high and far in some other sky

[Verse 2, Part 1: Will Sheff]
We sing, ""Is that marionette
Real enough yet to step off of that set
To decide what her hands might be doing?
Ruining the play, to in the ensuing melee escape""

We packed up all of our bags
The ship's deck now sags from the weight of our tracks
As we pace beneath flags black and battered
Rattling our swords in service of some faded foreign lord

The maps he sent to us don't mention lost coastlines
Where nothing we've actually seen has been mapped or outlined
And we don't recognize the names upon these signs

You worked hard, died poor
You mined what you died for
Diamonds

You can whistle my name
It's the mines in Africa
That are to blame
You can scoop out my brain
Shape it into an ear and then tell me your pain

Held death at bay from the first day
Stayed awake, stayed awake
The rabbit was removed under the whole moon
Long bird, short road

Dig deep but don't dig too deep
When it's late you'll see the hole is empty
And oh so deadly
They want me raw and smooth like glass
They want it fast but they don't want flaws
I'm a girl's best friend
Can you cut, I can cut, cause I'm a rough gem

Who lives in those lights in the distance?
Watered down, the rain will help you out
I had a dream, it was all a dream
But it was ruined by the sun shining through me"
1527,528,Take It Easy (Love Nothing),Bright Eyes,Digital Ash in a Digital Urn,10/26/2004,"First with your hands and then with your mouth
A downpour of sweat, damp cotton clouds
I was a fool, you were my friend
We made it happen
You took off your clothes, left on the light
You stood there so brave
You used to be shy
Each feature improved, each movement refined and eyes like a showroom
Now they are spreading out the blankets on the beach
That weatherman is a liar
He said it would be raining but it's clear and blue as far as I can see

Left by the lamp, right next to the bed
On a cartoon cat pad she scratched with a pen
""Everything is as it's always been
This never happened
Don't take it too bad it is nothing you did
It's just once something dies you can't make it live
You're a beautiful boy
You're a sweet little kid but I am a woman.""
So I laid back down and wrapped myself up in the sheet
And I must have looked like a ghost cause something frightened me
And since then I've been so good at vanishing

Now I do as I please and lie through my teeth
Someone might get hurt, but it won't be me
I should probably feel cheap but I just feel free...
And a little bit empty
No, it isn't so hard to get close to me
There will be no arguments
We will always agree
And I'll try and be kind when I ask you to leave
We'll both take it easy
But if you stay too long inside my memory
I will trap you in a song tied to a melody
And I will keep you there so you can't bother me"

A very strange, enchanted boy
They say he wandered very far
Very far, over land and sea
A little shy and sad of eye
But very wise was he

And then one day
One magic day he passed my way
While we spoke of many things
Fools and Kings
This he said to me:

""The greatest thing you'll ever learn
Is just to love and be loved in return""

Unusual you

Boxer in the ring, tryna defend myself

Shocking, 'cause I never knew love like this could exist

You'll never let me down
Answer my call, here after all

1535,536,If You Find Yourself Caught in Love,Belle and Sebastian,Our Favourite Party Songs,10/6/2003,"If you find yourself caught in love
Say a prayer to the man above
Thank him for everything you know
You should thank him for every breath you blow

If you find yourself caught in love
Say a prayer to the man above
You should thank him for every day you pass
Thank him for saving your sorry ass

If you're single, but looking out
You must raise your prayer to a shout
Another partner must be found
Someone to take your life beyond
Another TV ""I Love 1999""
Just one more box of cheapo wine

If you find yourself caught in love
You should say a prayer to the man above

If you don't listen to the voices then my friend
You'll soon run out of choices
What a pity it would be
You talk of freedom don't you see
The only freedom that you'll ever really know
Is written in books from long ago
Give up your will to Him that loves you
Things will change, I'm not saying overnight
But something has to give
You're too good looking not to live

If you find yourself out of love
Shed a tear for the one you love
Tell your boss that you've gone away
Down your tools for a holiday
If you're going off to war then I wish you well
But don't be sore
If I cheer the other team
Killing people's not my scene
I prefer to give the inhabitants a say
Before you blow their town away
I like to watch them play
I like to marvel at the random beauty of a simple village girl
Why should she be the one who's killed?

If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love
If you find yourself caught in love"

Thanks for all you've done
I've missed you for so long
I can't believe you're gone
You still live in me
I feel you in the wind
You guide me constantly

[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew what it was to be alone
Cause you were always there for me
You were always home waiting
But now I come home and I miss your face
Smiling down on me
I close my eyes to see

[Chorus]
And I know you're a part of me
And it's your song that sets me free
I sing it while I feel, I can't hold on
I sing tonight cause it comforts me

I carry the things that remind me of you
In loving memory of the one that was so true
You were as kind as you could be
And even though you're gone
You still mean the world to me

[Pre-Chorus]
I never knew what it was to be alone
Cause you were always there for me
You were always home waiting
But now I come home and it's not the same
It feels empty and alone
I just can't believe you're gone

And I know you're a part of me
And it's your song that sets me free
I sing it while I feel, I can't hold on
I sing tonight cause it comforts me

I'm glad it sets you free from sorrow
But I'll still love you more tomorrow
And you'll be here with me still
All you did you did with feeling
And you always found a meaning
And you always will
And you always will
And you always will

Hear the sirens, hear the sirens

[Verse 1]
Hear the sirens, hear the circus so profound
I hear the sirens more and more in this here town
Let me catch my breath to breathe then reach across the bed
Just to know we’re safe, I am a grateful man
The slightest bit of light and I can see you clear

[Chorus 1]
Oh, had to take your hand, and feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didn’t care, before you were here
I danced in laughter, with the ever after
But all things change, let this remain

[Verse 2]
Hear the sirens covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer, will they come for me next time?
For every choice, mistake I made it's not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay, I’ll wait, I’ll understand

[Chorus 2]
Oh, it’s a fragile thing, this life we lead
If I think too much, I can get over-
Whelmed by the grace, by which we live our lives
With death over our shoulders
Want you to know, that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above too
I studied your face, the fear goes away

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 2]
It’s a fragile thing, this life we lead

On fingers broken long ago
I read with every broken heart
We should become more adventurous

And if I get banished from the kingdom up above
I'd sacrifice money and heaven, all for love
Let me be loved, let me be loved

If my brain quits, well, I guess then that's just it
And if my hands stop working, you can call me lazy
And if I get pregnant, I guess I'll just have the baby
Let it be loved, let me be loved

I've been tryin' to nod my head
But it's like I've got a broken neck
Wanting to say ""I will"" as my last testament
For me to be saved and you to be brave
We don't have to walk down that aisle
'Cause if marriage ain't enough
Well, at least we'll be loved

[Verse 4]
I've felt the wind on my cheek
Comin' down from the east
And thought about how we are all
As numerous as leaves on trees
And maybe ours is the cause of all mankind
Get loved, make more, try to stay alive

But I'll never forget the way you feel right now

- No way
And I would do anything for love

And some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end

And some nights you're breathing fire
And some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before, or will again

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm crazy
Oh it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me
No one else can save me now but you

As long as the planets are turning
As long as the stars are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true-
You better believe it!

That I would do anything for love!
And I'll be there till the final act
And I would do anything for love!
And I'll take the vow and seal a pact

But I'll never forgive myself if we don't go all the way

And some days I pray for Soul

Of Sex and Drums and Rock 'N' Roll

And some nights I lose the feeling
And some nights I lose control
Some nights I just lose it all
When I watch you dance and the thunder rolls

[Pre-Chorus]
And maybe I'm lonely
That's all I'm qualified to be
There's just one and only
One and only promise I can keep

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the fires are burning
As long as your prayers are coming true
You better believe it!

[Chorus]
That I would do anything for love!
And you know it's true and thats a fact
I would do anything for love!
And there'll never be no turning back

But I'll never do it better than I do it with you

And in return, she'll get my support
She will listen to me when I want to speak
About the world we live in and life in general
Though my views may be wrong, they may even be perverted
She'll hear me out and won't easily be converted
To my way of thinking, in fact, she'll often disagree
But at the end of it all, she will understand me

I want somebody who cares for me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things in a different light

But when I'm asleep I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me and kiss me tenderly

Roll out the map and mark it with a pin
I will follow every direction
Just lace up your shoes while I'm fetching a sleeping bag, a tent...

All I need is somewhere I feel the grass beneath my feet
A walk on sand, a fire I can warm my hands
My joy will be complete

I thought about a new destination
I'm never short of new inspiration
Roll out the map and mark it with a gin
Made my plans to conquer the country
I'm waiting for you to get out of your situation
With your job and with your life

And I know it's not easy
When you don't get what you deserve
You can say that you love me
But that's not what I've heard
Tonight in L.A
Tonight in L.A
Well it's got to be that way
Tonight in L.A
Maybe ill get myself together
Or fall to pieces and run back home
Get me a ticket for an aeroplane
I'm tired of been alone
I was on mulholland drive
With the radio on
They played augusstus pablo
And Kings of Leon
He say he knew it's not easy
When you don't get what you deserve
And I know it's not easy
When you don't get what you deserve
You can say that you love me
But that's not what I've heard
Tonight in L.A

Well it's got to be that way

I think of you now we own each other
I think of you now we own each other

Tonight in L.A
Mars and the USA
And fall and the Milky Way
It's got to be that way
The gift is on Broadway
Home a million miles away, away, away
You met your match
Stars catch your eyes
You cry a bed
You've met your match
You burn like fire
I'd hire your love
You trust your man
You burn like a fire
I steal I lie I try with you
You built your love
You steal you lie
And love too steal
Like me you try
You cry a bed
You met your match"

Stupid in love
Oh
Stupid in love

[Verse 1]
Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

[Verse 2]
My new nickname is ""You Idiot"" (Such an idiot)
Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me ""Let go, he is not the one""
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

[Bridge]
Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on (Oh)
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love

[Chorus]
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid

1564,565,No Way Down,The Shins,Port of Morrow,,"Meet the son of a government man
And a pillar of salt
I was born with blood on my hands
And have all the signs of a bleeding heart

Living high on a giant hog
On a mountain so steep
Keep your head in a hollow log
As the ruling fog are about to creep

What have we done?
How'd we get so far from the sun?
Lost, lost in an oscillating phase
Where a tiny few catch all of the rays

Out beyond the western squalls
In an alien land
They work for nothing at all
They don't know the mall or the layaway plan

Dig yourself a beautiful grave
Everything you could want
Maybe those invisible slaves
Are too far away for a ghost to haunt

What will we charge?
Letting go of a claim so large
Oh, all of our working days are done
But a tiny few are having all of the fun

Get used to the dust in your lungs

Is there no way down
From this peak to solid ground
Without having our gold teeth
Pulled from our mouths?

Make me a drink strong enough
To wash away the dishwater world they said was lemonade
Walk with me after the show
Maybe we can find a way through the minefield in the snow

What will they charge?
Letting go of a claim so large
Oh, all of our working days are done
But a tiny few are having all of the fun

Apologies to the sick and the young
Get used to the dust in your lungs"

The way you held me up when I was down
And I won't forget the way you said
""Darling I love you, you gave me faith to go on""

Falling down under the pale moonlight

Just let me hold you while you're falling apart
Just let me hold you and we'll both fall down

Fall on me, tell me, everything you want me to be
Forever with you, forever in me, ever the same

We would stand in the wind
We were free like water
Flowing down
Under the warmth of the sun
Now it's cold and we're scared
And we've both been shaken
Yeah, look at us man
This doesn't need to be the end

Just let me hold you while you're falling apart
Just let me hold you and we'll both fall down

Fall on me, tell me, everything you want me to be
Forever with you, forever in me, ever the same
Call on me
And I'll be there for you and you'll be there for me
Forever it's you, forever in me, ever the same

You may need me there
To carry all your weight
But you're no burden I assure
You tide me over
With a warmth I'll not forget
But I can only give you love

Has her world outside it
Scrabbles in the earth with her fingers and her mouth
She's five years old

Threads worms on a string
Keeps spiders in her pocket
Collects fly wings in a jar
Scrubs horse flies
And pinches them on a line
Ohhh...!

She has one friend, he lives next door
They're listening to the weather
He knows how many freckles she's got
She scratches his beard

She's painting huge books
And glues them together
They saw a big raven
It glided down the sky
She touched it
Ohh...!

Today is her birthday
They're smoking cigars
He's got a chain of flowers
And sews a bird in her knickers
Ohhh...!

They're smoking cigars
They lie in the bathtub
A chain of flowers"

To justify all the hurt inside
Guess she knows from the smiles
And the look in their eyes
Everyone's got a theory about the bitter one

They're saying
""Mama never loved her much
And Daddy never keeps in touch
That's why she shies away
From human affection.""
But somewhere in a private place
She packs her bags for outer space
And now she's waiting
For the right kind of pilot to come (And she'll say to him...)

If you'll be, if you'll be my baby
I've got a ticket for a world
Where we belong
So would you be my baby?

She can't remember a time
When she felt needed
If love was red then she was color blind
All her friends, they've been tried for treason
And crimes that were never defined

She's saying
""Love is like a barren place
And reaching out for human faith
Is, is like a journey
I just don't have a map for.""

So, baby's gonna take a dive
And push the shift to overdrive
Send a signal that she's hanging
All her hopes on the stars (What a pleasant dream...)

What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us

And the places that you go
When the lights are turned down low
And I don't understand
All the things you've seen
But I'm slipping in between
You and your big... dreams
It's always you and my big dreams

And you tell me
That it's over
But I can't stand here in a patch of four leaf clover
And you're restless
And I'm naked
You've got to get out
You can't stand to see me shaking
No, could you let me go
I didn't think so

And you don't want to be here in the future
So you say
The present's just a pleasant
Interruption to the past
And you don't want to look much closer
Cause you're afraid to find out all the hope
That you had sent into the sky by now had... crashed
And it did because of me

And then you bring me home
Afraid to find out that you're alone, no
And I'm sleeping in your living room
But we don't have much room
To live

And I had dreams that I would learn to play guitar
Maybe cross the country
Become a rockstar
And there was hope in me
That I could take you there
But dammit you're so young
But I don't think I care
And if I hurt you then I'm sorry
Please don't think that this was easy

And then you bring me home
Cause we both know what its like to be alone, no
And I'm dreaming in your living room
But we don't have much room
To live

Standing in her underwear?
And I've been thinking, and I've thinking, no
But she's been drinking

And all that I could do
Was touch her long blond hair
And I was thinking, what I was thinking ya know
We've been drinking and it doesn't get me anywhere

This is because I can spell confusion with a K
And I can like it
It's to dying in another's arms
And why I had to try it
It's to Jimmy Eat World
And those nights in my car
When the first star you see may not be a star
I'm not your star?
Isn't that what you said
What you thought this song meant
You thought this song meant

And if this is what it takes
Just to lie in my mistakes
And live with what I did to you
And all the hell I put you through
I always catch the clock it's 11:11
And now you want to talk
It's not hard to dream
You'll always be my Konstantine

They'll never hurt you like I do
No, They'll never hurt you like I do

Did you know I miss you?
Did you know I miss you?

God, I miss you

And then you bring me home
And we'll go to sleep but this time not alone, no no
And you'll kiss me in your living room, oh
And you see, no, that I've been missing in my Living room
'Cause this is what I miss, what I miss
We don't have much room
I said, does anybody need that room?
Because we all need a little more room
To live

And when you smiled all the kids fell apart here

So don't pretend that you don't feel the pull

You look so good in the shoes of an outcast
I kissed your throat every time they said it wouldn't last
But then I knew you, I knew you, I knew you
I really knew you

We danced the junkies in the shadows of bad modern art
We clicked our heels and we wished we were home
One more tab and your silk hits the chrome

1600,601,Before I Move Off,Mount Kimbie,Crooks & Lovers,,"                            ""A Procession! A Procession!""

    I should wish to place upon record here our gratitude to all our friends upon the Amazon for the very great kindness and hospitality which was shown to us upon our return journey. Very particularly would I thank Senhor Penalosa and other officials of the Brazilian Government for the special arrangements by which we were helped upon our way, and Senhor Pereira of Para, to whose forethought we owe the complete outfit for a decent appearance in the civilized world which we found ready for us at that town. It seemed a poor return for all the courtesy which we encountered that we should deceive our hosts and benefactors, but under the circumstances we had really no alternative, and I hereby tell them that they will only waste their time and their money if they attempt to follow upon our traces. Even the names have been altered in our accounts, and I am very sure that no one, from the most careful study of them, could come within a thousand miles of our unknown land.

    The excitement which had been caused through those parts of South America which we had to traverse was imagined by us to be purely local, and I can assure our friends in England that we had no notion of the uproar which the mere rumor of our experiences had caused through Europe. It was not until the Ivernia was within five hundred miles of Southampton that the wireless messages from paper after paper and agency after agency, offering huge prices for a short return message as to our actual results, showed us how strained was the attention not only of the scientific world but of the general public. It was agreed among us, however, that no definite statement should be given to the Press until we had met the members of the Zoological Institute, since as delegates it was our clear duty to give our first report to the body from which we had received our commission of investigation. Thus, although we found Southampton full of Pressmen, we absolutely refused to give any information, which had the natural effect of focussing public attention upon the meeting which was advertised for the evening of November 7th. For this gathering, the Zoological Hall which had been the scene of the inception of our task was found to be far too small, and it was only in the Queen's Hall in Regent Street that accommodation could be found. It is now common knowledge the promoters might have ventured upon the Albert Hall and still found their space too scanty.

    It was for the second evening after our arrival that the great meeting had been fixed. For the first, we had each, no doubt, our own pressing personal affairs to absorb us. Of mine I cannot yet speak. It may be that as it stands further from me I may think of it, and even speak of it, with less emotion. I have shown the reader in the beginning of this narrative where lay the springs of my action. It is but right, perhaps, that I should carry on the tale and show also the results. And yet the day may come when I would not have it otherwise. At least I have been driven forth to take part in a wondrous adventure, and I cannot but be thankful to the force that drove me.

    And now I turn to the last supreme eventful moment of our adventure. As I was racking my brain as to how I should best describe it, my eyes fell upon the issue of my own Journal for the morning of the 8th of November with the full and excellent account of my friend and fellow-reporter Macdona. What can I do better than transcribe his narrative—head-lines and all? I admit that the paper was exuberant in the matter, out of compliment to its own enterprise in sending a correspondent, but the other great dailies were hardly less full in their account. Thus, then, friend Mac in his report:

                                                THE NEW WORLD
                            GREAT MEETING AT THE QUEEN'S HALL
                                            SCENES OF UPROAR
                                    EXTRAORDINARY INCIDENT
                                                WHAT WAS IT?
                            NOCTURNAL RIOT IN REGENT STREET
                                                         (Special)

    ""The much-discussed meeting of the Zoological Institute, convened to hear the report of the Committee of Investigation sent out last year to South America to test the assertions made by Professor Challenger as to the continued existence of prehistoric life upon that Continent, was held last night in the greater Queen's Hall, and it is safe to say that it is likely to be a red letter date in the history of Science, for the proceedings were of so remarkable and sensational a character that no one present is ever likely to forget them."" (Oh, brother scribe Macdona, what a monstrous opening sentence!) ""The tickets were theoretically confined to members and their friends, but the latter is an elastic term, and long before eight o'clock, the hour fixed for the commencement of the proceedings, all parts of the Great Hall were tightly packed. The general public, however, which most unreasonably entertained a grievance at having been excluded, stormed the doors at a quarter to eight, after a prolonged melee in which several people were injured, including Inspector Scoble of H. Division, whose leg was unfortunately broken. After this unwarrantable invasion, which not only filled every passage, but even intruded upon the space set apart for the Press, it is estimated that nearly five thousand people awaited the arrival of the travelers. When they eventually appeared, they took their places in the front of a platform which already contained all the leading scientific men, not only of this country, but of France and of Germany. Sweden was also represented, in the person of Professor Sergius, the famous Zoologist of the University of Upsala. The entrance of the four heroes of the occasion was the signal for a remarkable demonstration of welcome, the whole audience rising and cheering for some minutes. An acute observer might, however, have detected some signs of dissent amid the applause, and gathered that the proceedings were likely to become more lively than harmonious. It may safely be prophesied, however, that no one could have foreseen the extraordinary turn which they were actually to take.

    ""Of the appearance of the four wanderers little need be said, since their photographs have for some time been appearing in all the papers. They bear few traces of the hardships which they are said to have undergone. Professor Challenger's beard may be more shaggy, Professor Summerlee's features more ascetic, Lord John Roxton's figure more gaunt, and all three may be burned to a darker tint than when they left our shores, but each appeared to be in most excellent health. As to our own representative, the well-known athlete and international Rugby football player, E. D. Malone, he looks trained to a hair, and as he surveyed the crowd a smile of good-humored contentment pervaded his honest but homely face."" (All right, Mac, wait till I get you alone!)

    ""When quiet had been restored and the audience resumed their seats after the ovation which they had given to the travelers, the chairman, the Duke of Durham, addressed the meeting. 'He would not,' he said, 'stand for more than a moment between that vast assembly and the treat which lay before them. It was not for him to anticipate what Professor Summerlee, who was the spokesman of the committee, had to say to them, but it was common rumor that their expedition had been crowned by extraordinary success.' (Applause.) 'Apparently the age of romance was not dead, and there was common ground upon which the wildest imaginings of the novelist could meet the actual scientific investigations of the searcher for truth. He would only add, before he sat down, that he rejoiced—and all of them would rejoice—that these gentlemen had returned safe and sound from their difficult and dangerous task, for it cannot be denied that any disaster to such an expedition would have inflicted a well-nigh irreparable loss to the cause of Zoological science.' (Great applause, in which Professor Challenger was observed to join.)

    ""Professor Summerlee's rising was the signal for another extraordinary outbreak of enthusiasm, which broke out again at intervals throughout his address. That address will not be given in extenso in these columns, for the reason that a full account of the whole adventures of the expedition is being published as a supplement from the pen of our own special correspondent. Some general indications will therefore suffice. Having described the genesis of their journey, and paid a handsome tribute to his friend Professor Challenger, coupled with an apology for the incredulity with which his assertions, now fully vindicated, had been received, he gave the actual course of their journey, carefully withholding such information as would aid the public in any attempt to locate this remarkable plateau. Having described, in general terms, their course from the main river up to the time that they actually reached the base of the cliffs, he enthralled his hearers by his account of the difficulties encountered by the expedition in their repeated attempts to mount them, and finally described how they succeeded in their desperate endeavors, which cost the lives of their two devoted half-breed servants."" (This amazing reading of the affair was the result of Summerlee's endeavors to avoid raising any questionable matter at the meeting.)

    ""Having conducted his audience in fancy to the summit, and marooned them there by reason of the fall of their bridge, the Professor proceeded to describe both the horrors and the attractions of that remarkable land. Of personal adventures he said little, but laid stress upon the rich harvest reaped by Science in the observations of the wonderful beast, bird, insect, and plant life of the plateau. Peculiarly rich in the coleoptera and in the lepidoptera, forty-six new species of the one and ninety-four of the other had been secured in the course of a few weeks. It was, however, in the larger animals, and especially in the larger animals supposed to have been long extinct, that the interest of the public was naturally centered. Of these he was able to give a goodly list, but had little doubt that it would be largely extended when the place had been more thoroughly investigated. He and his companions had seen at least a dozen creatures, most of them at a distance, which corresponded with nothing at present known to Science. These would in time be duly classified and examined. He instanced a snake, the cast skin of which, deep purple in color, was fifty-one feet in length, and mentioned a white creature, supposed to be mammalian, which gave forth well-marked phosphorescence in the darkness; also a large black moth, the bite of which was supposed by the Indians to be highly poisonous. Setting aside these entirely new forms of life, the plateau was very rich in known prehistoric forms, dating back in some cases to early Jurassic times. Among these he mentioned the gigantic and grotesque stegosaurus, seen once by Mr. Malone at a drinking-place by the lake, and drawn in the sketch-book of that adventurous American who had first penetrated this unknown world. He described also the iguanodon and the pterodactyl—two of the first of the wonders which they had encountered. He then thrilled the assembly by some account of the terrible carnivorous dinosaurs, which had on more than one occasion pursued members of the party, and which were the most formidable of all the creatures which they had encountered. Thence he passed to the huge and ferocious bird, the phororachus, and to the great elk which still roams upon this upland. It was not, however, until he sketched the mysteries of the central lake that the full interest and enthusiasm of the audience were aroused. One had to pinch oneself to be sure that one was awake as one heard this sane and practical Professor in cold measured tones describing the monstrous three-eyed fish-lizards and the huge water-snakes which inhabit this enchanted sheet of water. Next he touched upon the Indians, and upon the extraordinary colony of anthropoid apes, which might be looked upon as an advance upon the pithecanthropus of Java, and as coming therefore nearer than any known form to that hypothetical creation, the missing link. Finally he described, amongst some merriment, the ingenious but highly dangerous aeronautic invention of Professor Challenger, and wound up a most memorable address by an account of the methods by which the committee did at last find their way back to civilization.

    ""It had been hoped that the proceedings would end there, and that a vote of thanks and congratulation, moved by Professor Sergius, of Upsala University, would be duly seconded and carried; but it was soon evident that the course of events was not destined to flow so smoothly. Symptoms of opposition had been evident from time to time during the evening, and now Dr. James Illingworth, of Edinburgh, rose in the center of the hall. Dr. Illingworth asked whether an amendment should not be taken before a resolution.

    ""THE CHAIRMAN: 'Yes, sir, if there must be an amendment.'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH: 'Your Grace, there must be an amendment.'

    ""THE CHAIRMAN: 'Then let us take it at once.'

    ""PROFESSOR SUMMERLEE (springing to his feet): 'Might I explain, your Grace, that this man is my personal enemy ever since our controversy in the Quarterly Journal of Science as to the true nature of Bathybius?'

    ""THE CHAIRMAN: 'I fear I cannot go into personal matters. Proceed.'

    ""Dr. Illingworth was imperfectly heard in part of his remarks on account of the strenuous opposition of the friends of the explorers. Some attempts were also made to pull him down. Being a man of enormous physique, however, and possessed of a very powerful voice, he dominated the tumult and succeeded in finishing his speech. It was clear, from the moment of his rising, that he had a number of friends and sympathizers in the hall, though they formed a minority in the audience. The attitude of the greater part of the public might be described as one of attentive neutrality.

    ""Dr. Illingworth began his remarks by expressing his high appreciation of the scientific work both of Professor Challenger and of Professor Summerlee. He much regretted that any personal bias should have been read into his remarks, which were entirely dictated by his desire for scientific truth. His position, in fact, was substantially the same as that taken up by Professor Summerlee at the last meeting. At that last meeting Professor Challenger had made certain assertions which had been queried by his colleague. Now this colleague came forward himself with the same assertions and expected them to remain unquestioned. Was this reasonable? ('Yes,' 'No,' and prolonged interruption, during which Professor Challenger was heard from the Press box to ask leave from the chairman to put Dr. Illingworth into the street.) A year ago one man said certain things. Now four men said other and more startling ones. Was this to constitute a final proof where the matters in question were of the most revolutionary and incredible character? There had been recent examples of travelers arriving from the unknown with certain tales which had been too readily accepted. Was the London Zoological Institute to place itself in this position? He admitted that the members of the committee were men of character. But human nature was very complex. Even Professors might be misled by the desire for notoriety. Like moths, we all love best to flutter in the light. Heavy-game shots liked to be in a position to cap the tales of their rivals, and journalists were not averse from sensational coups, even when imagination had to aid fact in the process. Each member of the committee had his own motive for making the most of his results. ('Shame! shame!') He had no desire to be offensive. ('You are!' and interruption.) The corroboration of these wondrous tales was really of the most slender description. What did it amount to? Some photographs. {Was it possible that in this age of ingenious manipulation photographs could be accepted as evidence?} What more? We have a story of a flight and a descent by ropes which precluded the production of larger specimens. It was ingenious, but not convincing. It was understood that Lord John Roxton claimed to have the skull of a phororachus. He could only say that he would like to see that skull.

    ""LORD JOHN ROXTON: 'Is this fellow calling me a liar?' (Uproar.)

    ""THE CHAIRMAN: 'Order! order! Dr. Illingworth, I must direct you to bring your remarks to a conclusion and to move your amendment.'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH: 'Your Grace, I have more to say, but I bow to your ruling. I move, then, that, while Professor Summerlee be thanked for his interesting address, the whole matter shall be regarded as 'non-proven,' and shall be referred back to a larger, and possibly more reliable Committee of Investigation.'

    ""It is difficult to describe the confusion caused by this amendment. A large section of the audience expressed their indignation at such a slur upon the travelers by noisy shouts of dissent and cries of, 'Don't put it!' 'Withdraw!' 'Turn him out!' On the other hand, the malcontents—and it cannot be denied that they were fairly numerous—cheered for the amendment, with cries of 'Order!' 'Chair!' and 'Fair play!' A scuffle broke out in the back benches, and blows were freely exchanged among the medical students who crowded that part of the hall. It was only the moderating influence of the presence of large numbers of ladies which prevented an absolute riot. Suddenly, however, there was a pause, a hush, and then complete silence. Professor Challenger was on his feet. His appearance and manner are peculiarly arresting, and as he raised his hand for order the whole audience settled down expectantly to give him a hearing.

    ""'It will be within the recollection of many present,' said Professor Challenger, 'that similar foolish and unmannerly scenes marked the last meeting at which I have been able to address them. On that occasion Professor Summerlee was the chief offender, and though he is now chastened and contrite, the matter could not be entirely forgotten. I have heard to-night similar, but even more offensive, sentiments from the person who has just sat down, and though it is a conscious effort of self-effacement to come down to that person's mental level, I will endeavor to do so, in order to allay any reasonable doubt which could possibly exist in the minds of anyone.' (Laughter and interruption.) 'I need not remind this audience that, though Professor Summerlee, as the head of the Committee of Investigation, has been put up to speak to-night, still it is I who am the real prime mover in this business, and that it is mainly to me that any successful result must be ascribed. I have safely conducted these three gentlemen to the spot mentioned, and I have, as you have heard, convinced them of the accuracy of my previous account. We had hoped that we should find upon our return that no one was so dense as to dispute our joint conclusions. Warned, however, by my previous experience, I have not come without such proofs as may convince a reasonable man. As explained by Professor Summerlee, our cameras have been tampered with by the ape-men when they ransacked our camp, and most of our negatives ruined.' (Jeers, laughter, and 'Tell us another!' from the back.) 'I have mentioned the ape-men, and I cannot forbear from saying that some of the sounds which now meet my ears bring back most vividly to my recollection my experiences with those interesting creatures.' (Laughter.) 'In spite of the destruction of so many invaluable negatives, there still remains in our collection a certain number of corroborative photographs showing the conditions of life upon the plateau. Did they accuse them of having forged these photographs?' (A voice, 'Yes,' and considerable interruption which ended in several men being put out of the hall.) 'The negatives were open to the inspection of experts. But what other evidence had they? Under the conditions of their escape it was naturally impossible to bring a large amount of baggage, but they had rescued Professor Summerlee's collections of butterflies and beetles, containing many new species. Was this not evidence?' (Several voices, 'No.') 'Who said no?'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH (rising): 'Our point is that such a collection might have been made in other places than a prehistoric plateau.' (Applause.)

    ""PROFESSOR CHALLENGER: 'No doubt, sir, we have to bow to your scientific authority, although I must admit that the name is unfamiliar. Passing, then, both the photographs and the entomological collection, I come to the varied and accurate information which we bring with us upon points which have never before been elucidated. For example, upon the domestic habits of the pterodactyl—'(A voice: 'Bosh,' and uproar)—'I say, that upon the domestic habits of the pterodactyl we can throw a flood of light. I can exhibit to you from my portfolio a picture of that creature taken from life which would convince you——'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH: 'No picture could convince us of anything.'

    ""PROFESSOR CHALLENGER: 'You would require to see the thing itself?'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH: 'Undoubtedly.'

    ""PROFESSOR CHALLENGER: 'And you would accept that?'

    ""DR. ILLINGWORTH (laughing): 'Beyond a doubt.'

    ""It was at this point that the sensation of the evening arose—a sensation so dramatic that it can never have been paralleled in the history of scientific gatherings. Professor Challenger raised his hand in the air as a signal, and at once our colleague, Mr. E. D. Malone, was observed to rise and to make his way to the back of the platform. An instant later he re-appeared in company of a gigantic negro, the two of them bearing between them a large square packing-case. It was evidently of great weight, and was slowly carried forward and placed in front of the Professor's chair. All sound had hushed in the audience and everyone was absorbed in the spectacle before them. Professor Challenger drew off the top of the case, which formed a sliding lid. Peering down into the box he snapped his fingers several times and was heard from the Press seat to say, 'Come, then, pretty, pretty!' in a coaxing voice. An instant later, with a scratching, rattling sound, a most horrible and loathsome creature appeared from below and perched itself upon the side of the case. Even the unexpected fall of the Duke of Durham into the orchestra, which occurred at this moment, could not distract the petrified attention of the vast audience. The face of the creature was like the wildest gargoyle that the imagination of a mad medieval builder could have conceived. It was malicious, horrible, with two small red eyes as bright as points of burning coal. Its long, savage mouth, which was held half-open, was full of a double row of shark-like teeth. Its shoulders were humped, and round them were draped what appeared to be a faded gray shawl. It was the devil of our childhood in person. There was a turmoil in the audience—someone screamed, two ladies in the front row fell senseless from their chairs, and there was a general movement upon the platform to follow their chairman into the orchestra. For a moment there was danger of a general panic. Professor Challenger threw up his hands to still the commotion, but the movement alarmed the creature beside him. Its strange shawl suddenly unfurled, spread, and fluttered as a pair of leathery wings. Its owner grabbed at its legs, but too late to hold it. It had sprung from the perch and was circling slowly round the Queen's Hall with a dry, leathery flapping of its ten-foot wings, while a putrid and insidious odor pervaded the room. The cries of the people in the galleries, who were alarmed at the near approach of those glowing eyes and that murderous beak, excited the creature to a frenzy. Faster and faster it flew, beating against walls and chandeliers in a blind frenzy of alarm. 'The window! For heaven's sake shut that window!' roared the Professor from the platform, dancing and wringing his hands in an agony of apprehension. Alas, his warning was too late! In a moment the creature, beating and bumping along the wall like a huge moth within a gas-shade, came upon the opening, squeezed its hideous bulk through it, and was gone. Professor Challenger fell back into his chair with his face buried in his hands, while the audience gave one long, deep sigh of relief as they realized that the incident was over.

    ""Then—oh! how shall one describe what took place then—when the full exuberance of the majority and the full reaction of the minority united to make one great wave of enthusiasm, which rolled from the back of the hall, gathering volume as it came, swept over the orchestra, submerged the platform, and carried the four heroes away upon its crest?"" (Good for you, Mac!) ""If the audience had done less than justice, surely it made ample amends. Every one was on his feet. Every one was moving, shouting, gesticulating. A dense crowd of cheering men were round the four travelers. 'Up with them! up with them!' cried a hundred voices. In a moment four figures shot up above the crowd. In vain they strove to break loose. They were held in their lofty places of honor. It would have been hard to let them down if it had been wished, so dense was the crowd around them. 'Regent Street! Regent Street!' sounded the voices. There was a swirl in the packed multitude, and a slow current, bearing the four upon their shoulders, made for the door. Out in the street the scene was extraordinary. An assemblage of not less than a hundred thousand people was waiting. The close-packed throng extended from the other side of the Langham Hotel to Oxford Circus. A roar of acclamation greeted the four adventurers as they appeared, high above the heads of the people, under the vivid electric lamps outside the hall. 'A procession! A procession!' was the cry. In a dense phalanx, blocking the streets from side to side, the crowd set forth, taking the route of Regent Street, Pall Mall, St. James's Street, and Piccadilly. The whole central traffic of London was held up, and many collisions were reported between the demonstrators upon the one side and the police and taxi-cabmen upon the other. Finally, it was not until after midnight that the four travelers were released at the entrance to Lord John Roxton's chambers in the Albany, and that the exuberant crowd, having sung 'They are Jolly Good Fellows' in chorus, concluded their program with 'God Save the King.' So ended one of the most remarkable evenings that London has seen for a considerable time.""

    So far my friend Macdona; and it may be taken as a fairly accurate, if florid, account of the proceedings. As to the main incident, it was a bewildering surprise to the audience, but not, I need hardly say, to us. The reader will remember how I met Lord John Roxton upon the very occasion when, in his protective crinoline, he had gone to bring the ""Devil's chick"" as he called it, for Professor Challenger. I have hinted also at the trouble which the Professor's baggage gave us when we left the plateau, and had I described our voyage I might have said a good deal of the worry we had to coax with putrid fish the appetite of our filthy companion. If I have not said much about it before, it was, of course, that the Professor's earnest desire was that no possible rumor of the unanswerable argument which we carried should be allowed to leak out until the moment came when his enemies were to be confuted.

    One word as to the fate of the London pterodactyl. Nothing can be said to be certain upon this point. There is the evidence of two frightened women that it perched upon the roof of the Queen's Hall and remained there like a diabolical statue for some hours. The next day it came out in the evening papers that Private Miles, of the Coldstream Guards, on duty outside Marlborough House, had deserted his post without leave, and was therefore courtmartialed. Private Miles' account, that he dropped his rifle and took to his heels down the Mall because on looking up he had suddenly seen the devil between him and the moon, was not accepted by the Court, and yet it may have a direct bearing upon the point at issue. The only other evidence which I can adduce is from the log of the SS. Friesland, a Dutch-American liner, which asserts that at nine next morning, Start Point being at the time ten miles upon their starboard quarter, they were passed by something between a flying goat and a monstrous bat, which was heading at a prodigious pace south and west. If its homing instinct led it upon the right line, there can be no doubt that somewhere out in the wastes of the Atlantic the last European pterodactyl found its end.

    And Gladys—oh, my Gladys!—Gladys of the mystic lake, now to be re-named the Central, for never shall she have immortality through me. Did I not always see some hard fiber in her nature? Did I not, even at the time when I was proud to obey her behest, feel that it was surely a poor love which could drive a lover to his death or the danger of it? Did I not, in my truest thoughts, always recurring and always dismissed, see past the beauty of the face, and, peering into the soul, discern the twin shadows of selfishness and of fickleness glooming at the back of it? Did she love the heroic and the spectacular for its own noble sake, or was it for the glory which might, without effort or sacrifice, be reflected upon herself? Or are these thoughts the vain wisdom which comes after the event? It was the shock of my life. For a moment it had turned me to a cynic. But already, as I write, a week has passed, and we have had our momentous interview with Lord John Roxton and—well, perhaps things might be worse.

    Let me tell it in a few words. No letter or telegram had come to me at Southampton, and I reached the little villa at Streatham about ten o'clock that night in a fever of alarm. Was she dead or alive? Where were all my nightly dreams of the open arms, the smiling face, the words of praise for her man who had risked his life to humor her whim? Already I was down from the high peaks and standing flat-footed upon earth. Yet some good reasons given might still lift me to the clouds once more. I rushed down the garden path, hammered at the door, heard the voice of Gladys within, pushed past the staring maid, and strode into the sitting-room. She was seated in a low settee under the shaded standard lamp by the piano. In three steps I was across the room and had both her hands in mine.

    ""Gladys!"" I cried, ""Gladys!""

    She looked up with amazement in her face. She was altered in some subtle way. The expression of her eyes, the hard upward stare, the set of the lips, was new to me. She drew back her hands.

    ""What do you mean?"" she said.

    ""Gladys!"" I cried. ""What is the matter? You are my Gladys, are you not—little Gladys Hungerton?""

    ""No,"" said she, ""I am Gladys Potts. Let me introduce you to my husband.""

    How absurd life is! I found myself mechanically bowing and shaking hands with a little ginger-haired man who was coiled up in the deep arm-chair which had once been sacred to my own use. We bobbed and grinned in front of each other.

    ""Father lets us stay here. We are getting our house ready,"" said Gladys.

    ""Oh, yes,"" said I.

    ""You didn't get my letter at Para, then?""

    ""No, I got no letter.""

    ""Oh, what a pity! It would have made all clear.""

    ""It is quite clear,"" said I.

    ""I've told William all about you,"" said she. ""We have no secrets. I am so sorry about it. But it couldn't have been so very deep, could it, if you could go off to the other end of the world and leave me here alone. You're not crabby, are you?""

    ""No, no, not at all. I think I'll go.""

    ""Have some refreshm"
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
nt, said the little man, and he added, in a confidential way, ain't it? And must be unless you had polygamy," only the other way round; you understand."""" He laughed like an idiot", while I made for the door.
,,,,,,
    I was through it, when a sudden fantastic impulse came upon me, and I went back to my successful rival, who looked nervously at the electric push.,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"Will you answer a question?"""" I asked.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"Well", within reason, said he.,,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"How did you do it? Have you searched for hidden treasure", or discovered a pole, or done time on a pirate, or flown the Channel,,,
,,,,,,
    He stared at me with a hopeless expression upon his vacuous, good-natured, scrubby little face.,,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"Don't you think all this is a little too personal?"""" he said.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"Well", just one question," I cried. """"What are you? What is your profession?""""",,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"I am a solicitor's clerk"," said he. """"Second man at Johnson and Merivale's"," 41 Chancery Lane.""""",,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"Good-night!"""" said I", and vanished, like all disconsolate and broken-hearted heroes, into the darkness,,,
,,,,,,
    One more little scene, and I have done. Last night we all supped at Lord John Roxton's rooms, and sitting together afterwards we smoked in good comradeship and talked our adventures over. It was strange under these altered surroundings to see the old, well-known faces and figures. There was Challenger, his drooping eyelids, his intolerant eyes, his aggressive beard
,,,,,,
    It was after supper, in his own sanctum—the room of the pink radiance and the innumerable trophies—that Lord John Roxton had something to say to us. From a cupboard he had brought an old cigar-box, and this he laid before him on the table.,,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"There's one thing", said he," """"that maybe I should have spoken about before this", but I wanted to know a little more clearly where I was. No use to raise hopes and let them down again. But it's facts, with us now. You may remember that day we found the pterodactyl rookery in the swamp—what? Well, somethin' in the lie of the land took my notice. Perhaps it has escaped you," so I will tell you. It was a volcanic vent full of blue clay."""" The Professors nodded."
,,,,,,
"    """"Well", now, in the whole world I've only had to do with one place that was a volcanic vent of blue clay. That was the great De Beers Diamond Mine of Kimberley—what? So you see I got diamonds into my head. I rigged up a contraption to hold off those stinking beasts," and I spent a happy day there with a spud. This is what I got.""""",,,
,,,,,,
    He opened his cigar-box, and tilting it over he poured about twenty or thirty rough stones, varying from the size of beans to that of chestnuts, on the table.,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"Perhaps you think I should have told you then. Well", so I should, only I know there are a lot of traps for the unwary, and that stones may be of any size and yet of little value where color and consistency are clean off. Therefore, and on the first day at home I took one round to Spink's," and asked him to have it roughly cut and valued.""""",
,,,,,,
    He took a pill-box from his pocket, and spilled out of it a beautiful glittering diamond, one of the finest stones that I have ever seen.,,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"There's the result"," said he. """"He prices the lot at a minimum of two hundred thousand pounds. Of course it is fair shares between us. I won't hear of anythin' else. Well", Challenger," what will you do with your fifty thousand?""""",,,
,,,,,,
"    """"If you really persist in your generous view", said the Professor," """"I should found a private museum"," which has long been one of my dreams.""""",,,
,,,,,,
"    """"And you"," Summerlee?""""",,,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"I would retire from teaching"," and so find time for my final classification of the chalk fossils.""""",,,,,
,,,,,,
"    """"I'll use my own", said Lord John Roxton," """"in fitting a well-formed expedition and having another look at the dear old plateau. As to you", young fellah, of course," will spend yours in gettin' married.""""",
,,,,,,
"    """"Not just yet", said I," with a rueful smile. """"I think", if you will have me,,,

The lights all on around us

And you leaned upon your elbow
And began to speak to me

And I grabbed your wrist and told you

That's the city for you
Break down, back out
And get what's coming to you
When you said you were falling apart
I thought you meant that you were falling apart

Will you be the first one to tell the neighbourhood papers
And all my family and friends that still care?
Did you buy what I sold?
Did you feel what I told you?
I hope that you still do
Will you
Promise yourself that this isn't all we've got?

Back down, cash out
That's the city for you
Break down, back out
And get what's coming to you
When you said you were falling apart

Break down, back out

It doesn't mean much
It doesn't mean anything at all

Is a cold room

From where I can't return
Where every step I took in faith betrayed me
And led me from
My home

No questions asked
You strip away the ugliness
That surrounds me

Am I already that gone?

My knees

Spackled some butter over my whole grain bread
Something tastes different, maybe it's my tongue
Something tastes different, suddenly I'm not so young

I'm just a stranger, even to myself
A re-arranger of the proverbial bookshelf
Don't be a fool girl, tell him you love him
Don't be a fool girl, you're not above him

I never thought I could love anyone but myself
Now I know I can't love anyone but you
You make me think that maybe I won't die alone
Maybe I won't die alone

Kiss the boys as they walk by, call me their baby
But little do they know, I'm just a maybe
Maybe my baby will be the one to leave me sore
Maybe my baby will settle the score

What have I become
Something soft and really quite dumb
Because I've fallen, oh
Cause I've fall-fallen
Oh, cause I've fall-fall-fallen
So far away from the place where I started from

I never thought I could love anyone
I never thought I could love anyone
I never thought I could love anyone
But you, but you, but you, but you, but you

Maybe I won't die alone"

Just a day, just an ordinary day
Just trying to get by
Just a boy, just an ordinary boy, but he was looking to the sky
And as he asked if I would come along
I started to realize
That everyday he finds just what he's looking for
And like a shooting star, he shines

[Chorus]
And he said, ""Take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand?""

[Verse 2]
And as he spoke, he spoke ordinary words
Though they did not feel
For I felt what I had not felt before
And you'd swear those words could heal
And as I looked up into those eyes, his vision borrows mine
And I know he's no stranger
For I feel I've held him for all of time, and he said

[Chorus]
""Take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand?""
In the palm of your hand

Please come with me
See what I see
Touch the stars for time will not flee
Time will not flee
Can you see?

Just a dream, just an ordinary dream
As I wake in bed
And the boy, that ordinary boy
Or was it all in my head?
Didn't he ask if I would come along?
It all seemed so real
But as I looked to the door
I saw that boy standing there with a deal, and he said

[Chorus]
""Take my hand
Live while you can
Don't you see all your dreams lie right in the palm of your hand?
In the palm of your hand
In the palm of your hand""

Check your pulse

Scared of a world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
The great indoors

Lamplight makes the shadows play
And posters take the walls away
The TV is your window pane
The view won't let you down
So put your faith in a late night show
I bet you didn't even know
Depends on how far out you go
The channel numbers change

[Chorus]
Scared of a world outside you should go explore
Pull all the shades and wander the great indoors
The great indoors

Though lately I can't blame you
I have seen the world
And sometimes wish your room had room for two
So go unlock the door
And find what you are here for
Leave the great indoors
Leave the great indoors

Could fly over mountains
Could laugh at the ocean

To lay down the hard lines

Nothing much could happen
Nothing we can't shake

We're certain to succeed

Carried me through desperation

Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

And it was all that you've given to me

Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own

In finding the place I conceived

That I don’t know of your sins
Until you are ready to confess

I’ll know, I’ll know

And you can use my skin
To bury secrets in
And I will settle you down
And at my own suggestion
I will ask no questions
While I do my thing in the background
But all the time, all the time
I’ll know, I’ll know

I can't help you out
While she is still around

And amidst this bitterness
If you'll just consider this
Even if it don’t make sense all the time
Give it time
And when the crowd becomes your burden
And you've early closed your curtain
I'll wait by the backstage door

While you try to find
The lines to speak your mind
And pry it open, hoping for an encore
And if it gets too late, for me to wait
For you to find you love me, and tell me so

To an island where we'll meet

Move so pretty you're all I see
As the world keeps spinning round
You hold me right here right now

Under bright lit skies
Mountains of maple leaves
Standing side by side

The phone lines
The street lights
Led me to you

And if you
Just sit tight
I'll be there soon

All those wasted miles
All those aimless drives
Through green aisles
Our careless life style
It was not so unwise
No

I rode right past
The train tracks on
Ancient as the stone
Blacked out on a bicycle
I made my way back home

The houses were humming
All through the night
And winter was coming
But that was alright

All those wasted miles
All those aimless drives
Through green aisles
Our careless life style
It was not so unwise
No

You're just a poor misguided fool
Who thinks they know what I should do
A line for me and a line for you
I lose my right to a point of view

I'll be your guide in the morning
You cover up bullet holes

As soon as you sound like him
Give me a call
When you're so sensitive
It's a long way to fall

You're just a poor misguided fool
Who thinks they know what I should do
A line for me and a line for you
I lose my right to a point of view"

People have the right to fly
And will when it gets compromised
Their hearts say ""move along""
Their minds say ""gotcha heart""
""Let's move it along""
Move it along

Where someone's last goodbye
Blends in with someone's sigh
Cause someone's coming home
In hand a single rose

And I won't be the last
No, I won't be the last

And live like it's an evergreen
It's just a season thing

That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And you won't be the first
No, you won't be the first
To love me

You can find me
If you ever want again
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around, I'll be around
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
You just might find if you give it time, you will wave hello again
You just might wave hello again

And find a love to call your own

Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue

But I'll make you this guarantee, see

No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors
I'm learning you
And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky
Like children do
I'll say to you

No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time

February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day

We should take a ride tonight around the town
And look around at all the beautiful houses
Something in the way that blue lights on a black night
Can make you feel more
Everybody, it seems to me, just wants to be
Just like you and me
Hey, hey

No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?

And we someday take that away

I thought we could wait for the fireworks
I thought we could wait for the snow
To wash over Georgia and kill the hurt
I thought I could live in your arms
And spend every moment I had with you
Stay up all night with the stars
Confess all the faith that I had in you (I had in you)

Too late, I'm sure and lonely
Another night, another dream wasted on you
Just be here now against me
You know the words, so sing along for me, baby

For heaven's sake I know you're sorry
But you won't stop crying
This anniversary may never be the same
Inside I hope you know I'm dying
With my heart beside me
In shattered pieces that may never be replaced
And if I died right now you'd never be the same

[Verse 2]
I thought with a month of apart
Together would find us an opening
And moonlight would provide the spark
And that I would stumble across the key
Or break down the door to your heart
Forever could see us - not you and me
And you'd help me out of the dark
And I'd give my heart as an offering (an offering)

And I will always remember you now, remember you now

Sleep alone tonight

How does he feel, how does he kiss?

How does he taste while he's on your lips?

I must look just like a fool here
In the middle of the road
Standing there in your rear view
And getting soaked to the bone
This land is flat as it is mean
A man can see for a hundred miles
So I'm still praying I might see
The glow of a brake light

[Chorus 1]
But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
I keep a looking for
The slightest sign that you might miss
What you left behind
I know there's nothing stopping you now
But I'd settle for a slowdown

I held on longer than I should
Believing you might change your mind
And those bright lights of Hollywood
Would fade in time

But your wheels just turn
Down the road ahead
If it hurts at all
You ain't showed it yet
You're just a tiny dot on that horizon line
Come on tap those brakes
Baby just one time

1681,682,In This Diary,The Ataris,"So Long, Astoria",3/4/2003,"Here in this diary
I write you visions of my summer
It was the best I ever had
There were choruses and sing-alongs
And that unspoken feeling
Of knowing that right now is all that matters

All the nights we stayed up talking
Listening to '80s songs
And quoting lines from all those movies that we love
It still brings a smile to my face

I guess when it comes down to it
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right

Breaking into hotel swimming pools
And wreaking havoc on our world
Hanging out at truck stops just to pass the time
The blacktop singing me to sleep

Lighting fireworks in parking lots
Illuminate the blackest nights
Cherry cokes under this moonlit summer sky
2015 Riverside, it's time to say goodbye

Get on the bus, it's time to go
Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart
And eventually you'll finally get it right

(Get it right)

Being grown up isn't half as fun as growing up
These are the best days of our lives
The only thing that matters is just following your heart

Such pain as this
Shouldn't have to be experienced
I'm still reeling from the loss
Still a little bit delirious

Near to you, I am healing
But it's taking so long
Cause though he's gone
And you are wonderful
It's hard to move on
Yet, I'm better near to you

You and I have something different
And I'm enjoying it cautiously
I'm battle scarred
But I am working oh so hard
To get back to who I used to be

He's disappearing, fading steadily
Well, I'm so close to being yours
Won't you stay with me, please

I only know that
I am better where you are

And would anything matter if you're already dead?

And should I be shocked now, by the last thing you said?
Before I pull this trigger, your eyes vacant and stained
And in saying you loved me made things harder, at best
And these words changing nothing as your body remains

And there's no room in this Hell, there's no room in the next
And our memories defeat us, and I'll end this duress

I’ve seen love go by my door
It’s never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
I've been shooting in the dark too long
When something’s not right, it’s wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Verse 2]
Dragon clouds so high above
I’ve only known careless love
It always just hit me from below
But this time 'round it’s more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry, if you don’t know
Can’t remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoilin’ me too much, love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Bridge 1]
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time

[Verse 4]
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine’ve been like Verlaine’s and Rimbaud
But there’s no way I can compare
All them scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

[Bridge 2]
You're gonna make me wonder what I’m doin’
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I’m sayin’
You're gonna make me give myself a good talking-to

I’ll look for you in old Honolulu
San Francisco or Ashtabula
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know

In the tall grass, in the ones I love

I will replace the noise with silence instead
Flushing out your head

If you like it violent
We can play rough and tumble
Fall into bed
And I won't breathe so you can recover

When you're in pieces
Just follow the echo of my voice
It's okay
Tune into that frequency

Don't fight your reflex
Embrace the instinct
You can feel your way
Through the burden we face in the end

Cause it breaks my heart
That we live this way
I know people need love
Them people never play the game
And we talk the talk
We communicate
Them people need love
Those people never play the game

Pleasure for pleasure
It eases consequence
And love for a fall
But I know you love to take the risk

The past is weakness
Don't beg the question when the answer is war
There are moments when I'm overcome

Cause it breaks my heart
That we live this way
I know people need love
Cause them people never play the game
And we talk the talk
We communicate
Them people need love
Those people never play the game

And it breaks my heart
And it breaks my heart
People need love"

Filled with sadness and confusion

Some kind of peace of mind

But for me they come a tumblin' down
Every day heartaches grow a little stronger
I can't stand this pain much longer

I walk in shadows searching for light
Cold and alone no comfort in sight
Hoping and praying for someone to care
Always moving and going nowhere

What becomes of the brokenhearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind
Help me

I'm searching though I don't succeed
But someone look, there's a growing need
All is lost, there's no place for beginning
All that's left is an unhappy ending

Now what becomes of the broken-hearted
Who had love that's now departed
I know I've got to find
Some kind of peace of mind

Wish that I could see the machinations
Understand the toil of expectations
In your mind
Hold me like you never lost your patience
Tell me that you love me more than hate me
All the time
And you're still mine

[Pre-Chorus]
So smoke 'em if you got 'em
Cause it's going down
All I ever wanted was you
Let's take a drink of heaven
This can turn around

[Chorus]
Let's raise a glass or two
To all the things I've lost on you
Tell me are they lost on you?
Just that you could cut me loose
After everything I've lost on you
Is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?
Baby, is that lost on you?
Is that lost on you?

Lost on you
Lost on you

You're not in this alone
Let me break this awkward silence
Let me go, go on record
Be the first to say I'm sorry
Hear me out

Well, if you take me down
Or would you lay me out?
And if the world needs something better
Let's give them one more reason now
Now, now!

[Pre-Chorus]
We walk in single file
We light our rails, and punch our time
Ride escalators colder than a cell
(C'mon!)

[Chorus]
This broken city sky like butane on my skin
Stolen from my eyes
Hello angel, tell me where are you?
Tell me where we go from here

This broken city sky like butane on my skin
Stolen from my eyes
Hello angel, tell me where are you?
Tell me where we go from here
Tell me, we go from

[Verse 2]
And in this moment
We can't close the lids, on burning eyes
Our memories blanket us
With friends we know, like fallout vapors

Steel corpses stretch out
Towards an ending sun, scorched and black
It reaches in and tears your flesh apart
As ice cold hands rip into your heart

[Bridge]
That's if you've still got one that's left
Inside that cave you call a chest
And after seeing what we saw
Can we still reclaim our innocence?
And if the world needs something better
Let's give them one more reason, now

[Chorus]
This broken city sky, like butane on my skin
Stolen from my eyes
Hello angel, tell me where are you?
Tell me where we go from here

This broken city sky, butane on my skin
Stolen from my eyes
Hello angel, tell me where are you?
Tell me where we go from here
Tell me, we go from here"

These days are gone
Loud enough to hold on
I think about the time we wasted
I think about the years to come
It's getting late and I can't call
It's getting late to face it all
I think about the time we wasted
My loneliness has slowly grown
I told you not to cross the line

And leave me with your love for granted
The letters from your broken heart
I think I might have lost them somewhere

Don't tell me 'bout your lies
Don't tell me 'bout your secrets

My love is easy
You are everything I need
Now your love is gone
I want it safe & guaranteed
Life is such a fine line
Looking at the bright line
I think about the time we wasted
For someday I'll be coming too
Tonight is dying on its own

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I got your love for granted
It doesn’t matter, right or wrong
As long as you are hiding somewhere

Don't tell me 'bout your lies
Don't tell me 'bout your secrets

Even though we've said it all
I would never let us fall with you
Hang on to a little chance, you bet I'm in

It's stupid

I'm sick and tired of the way that I feel
I'm always dreaming and it's never for real
I'm all alone with my deep thoughts
I'm all alone with my heart ache and my good intentions

I work to eat and drink, and sleep just to live
Feels like I'm never getting back what I give
I got a sad song in my sweet heart
And all I'll really ever need is some love and attention

And I don't want to cry my whole life through
I want to do some laughing too
So come on, come on, come on, come on and laugh with me

And I don't want to die without shaking up a leg or two
Yeah I want to do some dancing too

And sometimes, sugar, it just takes someone else
Sometimes you just gotta make it for yourself
And sometimes, baby, you just need someone else

And me fresh out of rope...
Please ignore the lisp, I never meant to sound like this
So take me and break me and make me strong like you
I'll be forever grateful to this and you

It's only you, beautiful
Or I don't want anyone
If I can choose it's only you

Fix me to a chain around your neck and wear me like a nickel
Even new wine served in old skins cheapens the taste
I shot the pilot, now I'm begging you to fly this for me
I'm here for you to use, broken and bruised
Do you understand?

It's only you, beautiful
Or I don't want anyone
If I can choose, it's only you
But how could I miscalculate... perfect eyes will have perfect aim
If I can choose, it's only you

“We're wrecking” and I'm dry like a drum...when you scream
So fine I'll leave... we're spent... we've got time and trials...
Measured in miles... we slave for days (and weeks)

It's only you, beautiful
Or I don't want anyone
If I can choose. It's only you
But how could I miscalculate... perfect lies from a perfect dame
If I can choose... it's only you"

So maybe I won't be alone
Take back now, my life you're stealing

But today, I'm fine without you
Runaway this time without you
And all I ever thought you would be
That face is tearing holes in me again

Off a list of others, you don't make sense

To take you back now, but you can't win

There will be a better view from here
And only lonesome you remains
And just the thought of you I fear
It falls away

I really want you

Many prophets preach on bended knee
Many clerics wasted wine
Do the bloody sheets
On those cobbled streets mean
I have wasted time?
Are there silver shores on paradise?
Can I come in from the cold?
I killed a man in a far away land
My enemy I'm told

[Chorus]
I really want you to really want me
But I really don't know if you can do that
I know you want to know what's right
But I know it's so hard for you to do that
And time's running out as often it does
And often dictates that you can't do that
But fate can't break this feeling inside
That's burning up through my veins
I really want you
I really want you
I really want you now
No matter what I say or do
The message isn't getting through
And you're listening to the sound
Of my breaking heart
I really want you
I really want you

[Verse 2]
Is a poor man rich in solitude?
Or will mother earth complain
Did the beggar pray for a sunny day but
Lady luck for rain
They say a million people bow and scrape
To an effigy of gold
I saw life begin
And the ship we're in
And history unfold

Would you still look in my eyes?
What happens when I grow old?
And all my stories have been told?
Will your heart still race for me?
Or will it march to a new beat?
If I was a simple man

If I was a simple man
I'd own no home, I'd own no land
Would you still stand by my side?
And would our flame still burn so bright?

Sometimes I wonder why
I'm so full of these endless rhymes
About the way I feel inside
I wish I could just get a ride

If I was a simple man
And I could make you understand
There'd be no reason to think twice
You'd be my sun; you'd be my light

What made you hesitate
To tell me with words what you really feel?
I can see it in your eyes
You mean all of what you say
I remember so long ago
See, I felt the same way
Now we both have separate lives and lovers
(And lovers)
Insignificantly enough we both have significant others

[Pre-Chorus]
Only time will tell
Time will turn and tell

[Chorus]
We are who we were when
Could've been lovers but at least you're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when
Who knew what we know now
Could've been more but at least you're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when

[Verse 2]
But thoughts they change and times they rearrange
I don't know who you are anymore
Loves come and go and this I know
I'm not who you recall anymore
But I must confess you're so much more than I remember
Can't help but entertain these thoughts
Thoughts of us together

[Chorus]
We are who we were when
Could've been lovers but at least you're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when
Who knew what we know now
Could've been more but at least you're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when

[Post-Chorus]
Nooooo nooooo
Nooooo nooooo
My day late friend

[Bridge]
So let me get this straight
All these years and you were no where to be found
And now you want me for your own
But you're a day late and my love she's still renowned

[Chorus]
We are who we were when
Could've been lovers but at least you're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when
Who knew what we know now
Could've been more but at least you're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when
We are who we were when
Could've been lovers but at least you're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when
Who knew what we know now
Could've been more but at least you're still my day late friend
We are who
We are who we were when"

I want to know your plans and how involved in them I am
When I go to sleep for good will I be forgiven?
And If you want roses you can go buy a bouquet
If that just won't cut it, well what can I say?

[Chorus]
You're what keeps me believing the world's not gone dead
Strength in my bones put the words in my head
When they pour out to paper, it's all for you
Cause that's what you do. That's what you do

[Verse 2]
I want to know your fear, from your feet to the back of your ears
When they raise the landing gear will your heart stay here?
If you could forgive me for being so brash, well you
You could hit me or whip me, I'd savor each lash

You're what keeps me believing the world's not gone dead
Strength in my bones put the words in my head
When they pour out to paper, it's all for you
Cause that's what you do

This is only a waste of our time
Cause soon we'll be leaving
Will this strength still be mine?
I'll look out for you 'til I die, 'til I rot
I'll remember you 'til I die, until I rot

You're what keeps me believing the world's not gone dead
Strength in my bones put the words in my head

Another cue for you to fold your ears

Chuggin' along to a song that belongs to the shifting of gears

Caution could but rarely ever helps

Dance the rigadoon around you

I lose my desideratum and now you

Am I your gal or should I get out of town
I just need to be reassured
Do you just deal it out or can you deal with all that I lay down?

Talking 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume
All I could think about was my next move

Oh but you were so shy, so was I
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

[Chorus: Keifer & Shawna]
Are you gonna kiss me or not?
Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot
But you're about to miss your shot
Are you gonna kiss me or what?

It was the best dang kiss that I ever had
Except for that long one after that
And I knew if I wanted this thing to last
Sooner or later I'd have to ask for your hand

So I took a chance
Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee
And you smiled and said to me

Thinking hopes and lots of dreams that aren't there?
Is it wicked not to care when you've wasted many hours
Talking endlessly to anyone that's there?

I know the truth awaits me
But still I hesitate because of fear

Skipping tickets, making rhymes
Is that all that you believe in?
Wearing rags to make you pretty by design
Rusting armor for effect
Its not fun to watch the rust grow
For it will all be over when you're dead

Counting acts and clutching thoughts
By the river where the moss grows
Over rocks the water running all the time
Is it wicked when you smile even though you feel like crying
Even though you could be sick at any time?

But if there was a sequel
Would you love me as an equal?
Would you love me till I'm dead?

If there was a sequel would you love me like an equal?
Would you love me till I'm dead
And if there was a sequel would you love me as an equal?
Would you love me till I'm dead
Or is there someone else instead?"

The tall buildings
Fading in the distance
Only dots on a map
Four five six
The two of us a perfect fit
You're all mine all mine

And all I can say
Is you blow me away

Like an apple on a tree
Hiding out behind the leaves
I was difficult to reach
But you picked me
Like a shell upon a beach
Just another pretty piece
I was difficult to see
But you picked me
Yeah you picked me

So softly
Rain against the windows
And the strong coffee
Warming up my fingers
In this fisherman's house
You got me
Searched the sand
And climbed the tree
And brought me back down

And all I can say
Is you blow me away

Like an apple on a tree
Hiding out behind the leaves
I was difficult to reach
But you picked me
Like a shell upon a beach
Just another pretty piece
I was difficult to see
But you picked me, yeah you picked me"

Little bird, have you got a key?
Unlock the lock inside of me
Where will you go to keep yourself afloat?
Feeling old until the wings unfolded
Caught me a long wind

[Bridge]
Where will we go
To keep ourselves afloat?

[Chorus]
I caught a long wind
A long life wind

[Verse 2]
I got to know the sky
But it didn't know me
Got to see the land
And land on top of the sea
And be the bird, be the key
And now the current tells
What the wave withheld
And then the lightning sang
Of where the light would land

[Bridge]
Where will you go
To keep yourself afloat?

[Chorus]
I caught a long wind
A long life wind

[Verse 3]
Like a swallow
A night owl
A little chickadee
Sad sparrow
Good morning bird
Good nightingale
I took a deep breath
And caught a long wind"

Satellites flashing by
It's a beautiful state we're in
But how can we love in isolation?
Think how happy we can be when we just try
We're nothing like we seem
Passionate words are never spoken
You don't know how I bleed
When I leave your side

[Chorus]
In your eyes, love's alive
You've come untied
'Cause we're flashing by
Like satellites

Take all the rules away
How can we live if we don't change?
We're always on display
Let's run and hide

I like to believe you are thinking of me
And when the sun comes through your window
I like to believe you’ve been dreaming of me

Dreaming

I know
'Cause I'd spend half this morning
Thinking about the t-shirt you sleep in

I should know
'Cause I'd spend all the whole day
Listening to your message I’m keeping and never deleting

When I saw you
Everyone knew
I liked the effect that you had on my eyes

But no one else heard
The weight of your words
Or felt the effect that they have on my mind

From across the great divide
Voices trapped in yearning
Memories trapped in time

And solitude my guide
Would I spend forever here
And not be satisfied

To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away

Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

So many times betrayed
Trying to find an honest word
To find the truth enslaved

Oh you speak to me in riddles
And you speak to me in rhymes
My body aches to breathe your breath
Your words keep me alive

To hold you down
Kiss you so hard
I'll take your breath away

Wipe away the tears
Just close your eyes dear

It's morning that I dread
Another day of knowing of
The path I fear to tread

Oh into the sea of waking dreams
I follow without pride
It's nothing stands between us here
And I won't be denied

And I would be the one
To hold you down
Kiss you so hard

Wipe away the tears

Never give a single fuck about me
Yeah, you bet she know that we ain't
Never gonna be together, I see
Yeah, you bet I go to see you when
I'm feeling like a drum without a beat
Yeah, you dance so good
And I think that's kinda neat

[Verse 2]
What you know about love?
What you know about life?
What you know about blood?
Bitch, you ain't even my type
Yeah right, yeah right
Yeah, you know I feel right
Yeah, you living right now
You don't ever pick sides
Yeah right, yeah right
I'm overthinking my pride
But I don't gotta look nice

She's such a teaser, she's such a star
Give me a reason or give me a chance

I'm alone in your heart, I'm alone
It tears me apart (I'm alone)

Doin' all I can do just to be close to you
Every time that we meet, I skip a heartbeat
Always up for a laugh, she's a pain in the arse;
Every time that we meet, I skip a heartbeat

Give me an evening, or give me a night
I'll show you the time of your life
I'll walk you home safe from the dark;
I'll give you my jacket, I'll give you my heart

But she won't come dancing tonight
She's having the time of her life (I'm alone)

Doin' all I can do just to be close to you
Every time that we meet, I skip a heartbeat
Always up for a laugh, she's a pain in the arse;
Every time that we meet, I skip a heartbeat

I do love, she does heartbreak
I did love till she broke my heart

I do love, she does heartbreak
I did love till she broke my heart

I do love, she does heartbreak
I did love till she broke my heart

I do love, she does heartbreak
I did love till she broke my heart

Doin' all I can do just to be close to you

I skip a heartbeat for you

Oh no, don't you dare hang up this phone

[Chorus]
HEY!
Give me space so I can breathe
Give me space so I can sleep
Give me space so you can drown in this with me

There's no antidote for irony, you say
That you have when you know that you don't
And you say that you can when you know that you won't

Give me space so I can breathe
Give me space so I can sleep
Give me space so you can drown in this with me

HEY!

Give me just one inch, I swear that's all I need

Sometimes they make me want to scream

It started way back in third grade
I used to sit beside Emmylou Hayes
A pink dress, a matching bow and her pony tail
She kissed me on the school bus, but told me not to tell

[Verse 2]
Next day I chased her 'round the playground
Across the monkey bars, to the merry-go-round
And Emmylou got caught passing me a note
Before the teacher took it, I read what she wrote

[Chorus]
""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

[Verse 3]
Now we're grown up and she's my wife
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes
Ain't much changed, I still chase Emmylou
Up and down the hall, around the bed in our room

[Verse 4]
Last night I took her out in a white limousine
Twenty years together, she still gets to me
Can't believe it's been that long ago
When we got started with just a little note

[Chorus]
""Do you love me, do you wanna be my friend?
And if you do
Well then don't be afraid to take me by the hand
If you want to
I think this is how love goes, check yes or no""

Unlucky, I’ve got nowhere to go and so I follow my feet

A choice is facing you, a healthy dose of pain
A choice is facing you as you stare through the rain
A choice is facing you but I choose to refrain for today
Tomorrow we’ll be back in trouble again

Dream one, you had a whole lot of fun with a comedian
Stop short of going all the way, you’ll have to make it someday

Why is this happening to you, you’re not a child?
Why is this happening? You’ve too much on your mind
Things creep up on you when you are fast asleep
You are dreaming, you are sleepy
You are stuck to the sheets

In a town so small there’s no escaping you
In a town so small there’s no escape from view
In a town so small there’s nothing left to do

Dream two you couldn’t see her face but you saw everything else
Dream two was pretty special, easily beats loving yourself

Could you put a name to someone else's sigh?
Could you put a face to someone else's eyes?
Is it someone that you’d maybe recognize?
But it all fades into morning when you open your eyes"

On Butler Street out in the dark
Remember when we lost the keys
And you lost more than that in my backseat baby

Remember how we used to talk
About busting out - we'd break their hearts
Together - forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

Remember days of skipping school
Racing cars and being cool
With a six pack and the radio
We didn't need no place to go

Remember at the prom that night
You and me we had a fight
But the band they played our favorite song
And I held you in my arms so strong

We danced so close
We danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together - forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye

EXT. WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT - DAY

A crisp and perfect New England town.  Almost too neat
to be real.  No visible townspeople.  CAMERA EXPLORES
town.


CAMERA FLIES

over a rickety bridge -- PAST the Maitland Hardware and
Appliance store -- PAST the church -- the Historical
Society -- UP over the graveyard on the hill and
finally --

To the Maitland house.  The perfect Victorian house
surveying the tiny village.  Suddenly --


A GIANT DADDY LONGLEGS SPIDER

mounts the crest of the hill beside the house, pauses to
wave a spindly leg and then creeps menacingly on top of
the Maitland house.

ADAM (O.S..)
Well, well, you're a big fella...!

A hand -- as big as God's -- with a huge tweezer,
gently reaches down out of the sky and lies, palm up,
in the yard next to the house.  Daddy Longlegs climbs
into it.  The hand rises into the sky again.


INT. ATTIC - NEW ANGLE - DAY

Reveals Winter River as a miniature town, while The
Daddy Longlegs and the hand are normal size.  Above the
model are a homely representation of moon, sun, and
stars -- a whole, tiny, mechanical universe to track
the hours of the day.  A large plat map of the city is
prominent on the wall.

The hand is ADAM MAITLAND'S.  In his late 30's, he's a
solid easy-going citizen.  Capra used to make movies
about him.

Adam's model town sprawls across most of the attic
space.  Windows on either end of the attic shed good
light into the warm room.  Adam very carefully lifts
the spider out the open window.  Smiles as he drips him
lightly on the breeze.


CAMERA TILTS UP FROM THE WINDOW

To see the real Winter River, laid out exactly as the
model, at the foot of the hill.  Adam breathes deeply
and looks very pleased at the glorious town below him.


ON HIS HUGE HAND AGAIN

as it reaches into model and tweezes a tiny sign into
the tiny window of Maitland's Hardware Store on main
street.  It reads:

ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND
ARE
ON VACATION!
HOORAY!

Adam leans down and eyes the sign.

BARBARA
(behind him)
I'm ready!

Adam turns to see entering:  BARBARA MAITLAND, 35 -- a
wholesome beauty who is mellowing well.  She smiles at
him.  Perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her,
because they don't have children.

ADAM
(happy to see her)
She's ready.

BARBARA
(eyeing the model)
It looks great.

ADAM
(nodding)
Thanks.

She pushes a wrapped present across the table.

BARBARA
Happy vacation, honey!

Adam smiles and gives her a present he's hidden under
the table.  He opens his present.  A can of furniture
oil.

ADAM
Manchurian Tung oil?
(playfully grabs
Barbara and kisses
her)
Where did you get it?

BARBARA
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
There's enough to refinish the
gateleg table and the cherry
wardrobe...

Adam hands Barbara a carefully-wrapped bundle -- she
unwraps her gift... rolls of very expensive floral
wallpaper.  She cradles it in her arms like gold leaf.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam... it's beautiful.

Adam nods, and embraces her.

ADAM
Enough to do the guest room...

BARBARA
(cooing)
I'm so glad we're spending our
vacation at home...
(with a sudden resolve)
... I'm going to get started right
now!

ADAM
(pulling her back)
Whoa!... hold on...

Barbara calms down, returning to Adam's embrace... as:

PHONE RINGS -- They freeze, then grin.

ADAM & BARBARA
(unison)
No one's home!

HONK HONK outside.  They look at each other horrified.
Peer out the window.

BARBARA
Oh no.

ADAM
(pointing at her)
It's your turn, darling.

She shakes her head with resignation and goes downstairs.
KNOCKING on door from below.


INT. STAIRCASE AND KITCHEN - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS Adam and Barbara downstairs.  We see the
rambling, old fashioned quality to the house.

Clean, sentimental, warm and floral.  Some rooms in
progress.  They continue down the main staircase past
photos of themselves, old photos of the early days of
Winter River, pictures and mementos of three
generations in hardware.  Barbara goes to the kitchen
and Adam continues down to the basement.


HER POV - A WOMAN

JANE BUTTERFIELD -- tall, gawky and aggressive peeks in
the kitchen door.  She's divorced three husbands and
buried another for good measure.  She's ruthless but is
weirdly, seamlessly pleasant.  She waves a legal sized
paper at them, starts to come inside.


INT./EXT. KITCHEN DOOR

Barbara makes dash for it and holds it just as Jane gets
a foot in.  Jane smiles wildly.

JANE
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you.
I heard you were on vacation!

BARBARA
That's right, Jane.  Complete
vacation.

JANE
Honey -- today I am three hundred
fifty thousand dollars!

BARBARA
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the
morning!

JANE
Look at me, think of me as cash!
This offer is really real!  From a
rich man in New York City who only
saw a photograph!
(rattles on)
My buyer has just made a killing
in condos in Manhattan, but he's
got a little stress problem...
(taps her head)
... so -- he wants to bring the
wife and kid for the old peace and
quiet.

BARBARA
That's what we're looking for,
too.

JANE
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, just
listen now.  This house is too
big.  It really ought to be for a
couple with a family.

That hurts Barbara a little.  She looks at Jane.

JANE
(continuing)
Oh, honey... I didn't mean
anything... it's just too big for
you.

Jane compulsively affixes her business card, face inside.
in the windowpane.

BARBARA
(shutting door)
'Bye, Jane, see you in a few
weeks.


ADAM

is humming happily, looking for paint brushes in the
ground floor storeroom.  He spies a cassette deck and
looks through a stack of cassettes and plays one.  It
is an old INKSPOTS LOVE SONG.


INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

Barbara is starting to paper the walls already.  She
frowns at the MUSIC.  Goes to the door.

BARBARA
Oh, honey.  You said no Inkspots
on this vacation!

It CLICKS OFF.  She goes back into the room.


INT. STOREROOM - DAY

Adam puts away the tape but keeps humming the song.  He
opens the shutters on a small window.  ON WINDOW...

JANE
(her huge face
grinning at him)
Boo!

He jumps back, frightened.

ADAM
No, Jane.

Adam closes the shutters as Jane affixes yet another
card to the window.  He continues his search for a
brush.


JANE

exits jauntily, flapping her contract down the lawn.


INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Adam continues rummaging for a brush.  Can't find it.

ADAM
(calling to distant
Barbara)
Honey, come with me down to the
store?

BARBARA (O.S.)
What for?

ADAM
I need a good brush for this Tung
oil and I want to pick up a piece
of the model.  Let's go early
before anyone sees us.

Barbara has already papered a few rolls in the guest
room.

BARBARA
Okay, but let's hurry back.  You
just run in okay?


EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

The Victorian house from the model ""in the flesh.""
Adam stands by the station wagon.

On the bumper of the car is a sticker reading:
WARNING:  I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS.

Barbara gets in driver's side.  They drive off.


INT. THE CAR - DAY

Adam dusts the inside of the dashboard.  Clean Clean.

BARBARA
(preoccupied)
Jane said we should sell the house
to someone with a family.

ADAM
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.

Puts his hand on her shoulder.


EXT. THE RIVER AND BRIDGE AND HILL - DAY

We see the car coming down the hill toward the bridge.

ADAM (V.O.)
We should be flattered that she
wants to sell our house.

BARBARA (V.O.)
I know... I just wish she'd leave
us alone.

ADAM (V.O.)
Let's not think about it.  We'll
have a nice romantic, quiet,
vacation.  Here comes the bridge
chorus.

Car reaches the rickety covered bridge.  Car shakes,
bobbing up and down on every plank.

ON Barbara and Adam TIGHT -- (they've done this routine
before).  They sing an old Johnny Mathis song.  With a
lot of vibrato.

TOGETHER
Chances are... When I wear a
foolish grin...

They laugh.


EXT. DOWNTOWN WINTER RIVER - DAY

Just like the model, but real.  And populated.

CAMERA PAUSES ON a gorgeous storefront with a brass
lion out front.  Sign above doors says --

BOZMAN BUILDING 1835

An old man polishes the lion as Maitlands drive by and
wave.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Wave at the lion.

ADAM (V.O.)
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

BARBARA (V.O.)
(embarrassed)
Adam!

Ernie looks around to see no one's looking and polishes
the balls of the lion.


CAMERA SPIES A JAUNTY DOG

like Benji, peeing on the opposite corner of the lion.
Maitlands drive by store with sign:

JANE BUTTERFIELD
ANTIQUES
REAL ESTATE
TRAVEL


INT. ANTIQUE STORE REAL ESTATE OFFICE TRAVEL AGENCY -
DAY

The store is bursting with antiques of all sorts,
travel brochures, photographs of houses for sale, and a
serve-yourself Xerox machine.  LITTLE JANE, her eight-
year-old daughter is drudgingly making copies.

Jane, phone in hand, rushes to the window to watch
Maitlands drive by.  Almost popping the cord when it
reaches its end.  She's waiting for the other party to
pick up.

JANE
Y... ello.  Mrs. Deetz?  Well the
condition is what we country folk
call, fixin'... Yes, I think they
are fixin' to accept another
offer.  Well maybe if you offer
390,000 they'll take it.


EXT. MAITLAND HARDWARE - DAY

Adam sprints up the steps of his lovely hardware store.
OLD BILL, a slightly-addled ancient barber, is napping
in a chair in front of his shop, next door to Adam's.
Adam fumbles with the lock, not interested in conver-
sation.  He drops his keys, waking Old Bill.

OLD BILL
'Morning, Adam.  You need a
haircut before your vacation?

ADAM
No thanks, Bill.

OLD BILL
How's the model coming?

ADAM
Good, Bill -- Good.

Bill turns around and continues prattling even though
Adam has entered.  Bill prattles throughout.

OLD BILL
Y'know, I was thinkin'... you said
Bozman built the foundation in
1835 but y'know his grandson came
in here last week and said he
found a bottle with an 1836 stamp
in it plastered in the foundation.
(suddenly disgusted
at the memory)
He's got hair down to his
goddamned shoulders...


INT. MAITLAND HARDWARE

Adam pulls down a few good paintbrushes and carefully
picks up a small model of the Bozman building.  He
walks out.  Old Bill continues unabated.

OLD BILL
He said ""Just give me a trim..."" I
took a scissors to him so fast...
would've skimmed him clean if he
hadn't...

Adam strides by quickly to the car.

ADAM
See you, Bill.

OLD BILL
Right.


EXT. MAITLAND'S CAR - DAY

The Maitlands drive their car out of town.


ON JANE


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE - DAY

Car approaches.


INT. CAR - DAY

Five brushes sit on the seat next to Adam.  He cradles
small replica of the Bozman building, complete with
brass lion.

BARBARA
It's a beauty.

ADAM
Yeah it turned out okay.  We
applied for a historical plaque
for it.  That'll be the third one
on Main Street.

BARBARA
(jokingly)
With all these historical
landmarks in town, where are they
going to put the condominiums?

ADAM
(grinning)
Slow down there, honey... I don't
want the vibration to weaken the
model.

BARBARA
(nervous)
Oh... I'm sorry...

Barbara starts to apply the brakes.

Just before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road.
Stops to pee.  Barbara swerves.  As the car hits the
rickety bridge, the speed is just a bit too much.

Boards RATTLE and loosen, the car skews and catches in
an open slot, careens to the right, then the left and
the bridge.


INT. CAR - DAY

A piling has smashed through the window on the pas-
senger side, crushing the upper part of Barbara's
arm.  She is wailing in pain and fright.

Adam tries to help Barbara.  He tries to get out of the
car.  None of this succeeds.


EXT. BRIDGE AND RIVER - DAY

The dog finishes, looks over at the car, walks across
the bridge and steps on the one board which holds the
car aloft.

The car rocks back and forth for a moment, and then
slides forward toward the water.


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE

The car plunges into the rushing water.  It floats
for a moment, and then sinks like a stone.

FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN:

INT. BARBARA AND ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Quiet, still, expectant.  There is a fire laid in the
hearth.  Suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites
and burns with a furious cheerfulness.

Barbara and Adam enter, dazed, wet, and bedraggled.

BARBARA
Something like this always happens
when we try to go on vacation.
Always.

Adam leads her toward the fire.

ADAM
You'll feel better when you're
dry.

He holds out his hands to be warmed.  Barbara comes up
beside him.  All this time she's been holding her
injured arm with the other hand.

BARBARA
This fire wasn't burning when we
left the house.

ADAM
How's your arm?

BARBARA
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.

She holds her arms out to warm them.  One hand catches
on fire.


BARBARA'S LEFT ARM

They stare at it dumbfoundedly before Adam regains his
senses and snatches it out of the fire.  Two of the
fingers are burning like candles, and Barbara indus-
triously blows them out.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam.

CUT TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM:  A FEW MINUTES LATER - DAY

They are sitting on the couch together.  Barbara is
looking away slightly -- as one does when a doctor is
drawing blood -- while Adam looks at her fingers.  He
frowns.

He looks at his skin.  It is pale.  He looks at
Barbara.

ADAM
You'd better sit down, hon.

BARBARA
I am sitting.

ADAM
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I
don't think we survived that
crash.

BARBARA
(pause)
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own
house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some
coffee.  You get some more
firewood.

Adam gets up, a little absently, she follows him as he
wanders to the front door.  He peers out.

ADAM
Let's take things extra slow.  Do
you remember how we got back up
here?

Barbara tests her hand, clenches and unclenches her
fist.

BARBARA
I'm fine.  My arm works fine.

Adam, exploring, opens the door, steps out on the front
porch.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - TWILIGHT

Adam's face is painted with color of sunset.  He stands
atop the steps leading down to the front yard.  Barbara
stands just inside the open threshold, looking out
worriedly.

BARBARA
(quiet sarcasm)
The end of a perfect day.

Adam starts to step down to the yard.

ADAM
Honey, I'm gonna go down to the
bridge and retrace our steps.

He steps off the last step into the yard and promptly
disappears.

BARBARA
Adam!


EXT. THE GREAT VOID

Adam is nowhere.  There's no ground, no sky, nothing to
stand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance.
Just vast nothing.  Not white and not colored either.
NOISE OF A CLOCK TICKING.

Adam looks about surprised, doesn't like what he
doesn't see.  He turns around to head back up the
steps.  There are no steps.

ADAM
Barbara?

His VOICE ECHOES STRANGELY.  He runs off a little in
the distance, and calls again from over there.

ADAM
(continuing; quietly)
Where are you?

He goes even farther away.


IN THE FOREGROUND

an enormous geared wheel -- the size of a man -- rolls
by, tearing up the unseamed ground.  Something pours up
out of the tear -- ooze or stuffing.

Adam runs forward and stares after the wheel, which is
now out of sight.


TWO SMALLER GEARS

looking very much like components of a giant watch --
spin along behind him.  One of them veers suddenly
toward him, and though Adam jumps out of the way, the
gear snags his trouser leg and shreds it.  LOUD
TICKING.


A PERFECTLY ENORMOUS GEAR

comes barreling toward him.  Adam leaps out of its
way.  The gear turns, fish-tailing, kicking up ooze and
stuffing.

Adam flings himself suddenly to the right, but trips
into the path of the gear.  As he's about to be
crushed, he's suddenly jerked up to safety.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

It's Barbara who's grabbed him, and quite evidently
saved his life -- not life, perhaps -- but existence.
He's shaken, breathless.

Barbara stares at him, as if wondering what he's just
been through.

ADAM
(weakly)
You saved my -- uh -- life... or
whatever...

BARBARA
Two hours.

ADAM
What?

BARBARA
That's how long you were gone.

ADAM
(pondering that)
... Hmmm?


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara leads Adam into the house.

ADAM
Anything happen while I was away?

BARBARA
Yes, it did.  Yes, it did.  I made
a couple of small discoveries.


BARBARA

stands by the mirror over the hearth mantle.  On the
mantle is Barbara's prize collection of porcelain
horses.  Adam comes to stand beside her.  They look
into the mirror, and there is no reflection of them.

Barbara picks up one of the horses, and trots it through
the air.  The horse is imaged in the mirror.

BARBARA
(continuing)
There's that, and there's this.

She picks up an ancient, leather-bound book.  It's
yellow and worn, about the size of the Boy Scout
manual.

CLOSEUP:  Its title is HANDBOOK FOR THE RECENTLY
DECEASED.

ADAM
(reading)
Handbook for the recently
diseased.

BARBARA
Deceased.  I don't know where it
came from.  Look at the publisher.

ADAM
(he does and reads)
Handbook for the Recently Deceased
Press.

BARBARA
(finally admit-
ting it)
I don't think we survived the
crash.


INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam is already in bed, reading from the handbook.
Barbara is getting ready for bed -- going through a
ritual of sorts that they practiced every night of
their married lives.

BARBARA
I don't like situations like this.
I hate it when I'm not in control.
So just tell me the basics.

ADAM
This book isn't arranged that
way.  What do you want to know?

BARBARA
There are a thousand things... Why
did you disappear when you walked
off the front porch?  Is this a
punishment?  Are we halfway to
heaven or are we halfway to hell?
And how long is this going to
last?

ADAM
I don't see anything about
""Rewards and Punishments"" or
""Heaven and Hell.""
(frustrated)
This book reads like stereo
instructions!  Listen to this...
'Geographical and Temporal
Perimeters... Functional
perimeters vary from manifestation
to manifestation.""  This is going
to take some time.


BARBARA

paces, she trips on her wallpaper rolls.  Kicks them.

BARBARA
I knew I'd never finish the guest
room.  Adam, we just can't stay in
here forever!

They look at each other, the question hangs in the air.
Can't they?

Adam stands and walks to the window.

ADAM
(thoughtfully)
Maybe we should set up a normal
routine.

She looks at him like he's nuts.

ADAM
(continuing)
I mean, let's try to nail down
something in our lives.  A regular
schedule.  We can keep track of
time and go on with our projects
up here in the attic.

She shakes her head, exasperated.  Flops down on the
bed.

BARBARA
Oh, God, maybe this is all just a
bad dream.

ON ADAM - TIGHT - a somber look comes across his face.

ADAM
I'm afraid not, honey.

Barbara looks up at him, questioningly.

BARBARA
Why?  What's wrong?  Adam?

She stands and joins him at the window.


THEIR POV THROUGH THE WINDOW

In the distance we see an automobile funeral procession
threading its way toward the nearby cemetery.  Head-
lights are on.  We recognize Jane's car in the line.


REVERSE ON BARBARA AND ADAM

somber faces.


TIGHTER ON PROCESSION

It arrives at the gravesite.  We see some familiar
faces, Ernie, and Old Bill the Barber.  Jane and little
Jane watch as two identical coffins are carried to-
gether, to two open graves.


ON BARBARA AND ADAM

She drops her head sadly on his shoulder.  He leans his
face slightly into hers.

FADE OUT.


FADE IN:

INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam is setting up a small monument in the model town
cemetery.  It reads:  ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND/UNITED
IN LIFE/UNDIVIDED IN DEATH.

ADAM
I wish I had a better view of the
cemetery from up here.  I don't
know which area is the best
placement for us.

Barbara, trying to clean, lets out a frustrated YELP!
She paces.

ADAM
(continuing)
Cabin fever, han?

BARBARA
I can't clean anything.  The
vacuum is out in the garage.  I
can't leave the house.  Why don't
they tell us something?  Where are
all the other dead people in the
world?  Why is it just you and me?

ADAM
Maybe this is heaven.

BARBARA
(looking at the
dusty walls)
In heaven there wouldn't be dust
on the wallpaper.

ADAM
Hon... I didn't want to die, but
really, this is fine with me.
Look, we never have to wash dishes
again.

BARBARA
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three
weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you.  I
really need to be around people,
get out to the church and go
grocery shopping.

ADAM
But I'm not hungry, are you?

Barbara shakes her head and picks up the Handbook and
pages through it desperately.

BARBARA
I keep having this feeling that
something has got to happen.

CAR DOOR SLAMS outside.  Adam and Barbara look at one
another.  Run to window.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane Butterfield is staring up at the old house.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam, from his angle, can just barely see her.

ADAM
God, it's Jane.

BARBARA
What's she doing here?

ADAM
I don't know.
(shouting)
Jane, Jane, up here!


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Unhearing, Jane heads for car.  SOUND OF WIND UP.
Blows her dress.  Little Jane straggles along with her
like an apprentice.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara watches Adam, and shakes her head.  He stops.

BARBARA
She can't see you, right?

Adam nods.

BARBARA
(continuing)
In the book, Rule Number Two:  the
living usually won't see the dead.

ADAM
Won't?  Or can't?

BARBARA
Just says ""won't.""  Wait a minute.
Here it says ""the living are
arrogant... they think they'll
never die, so they refuse to see
the dead.""

ADAM
Arrogant.  That's Jane all right...

Barbara sighs and nods.

BARBARA
At least we won't have to worry
about her.

Adam smiles and goes to his model.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane drives away.  CAMERA HINGES to see a FOR SALE
sign.  Across it -- another smaller banner.  It reads:
SOLD!

CUT TO:


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

The Maitlands are asleep.  CAMERA EXPLORES the room a
bit.  It is getting slightly tatty.  Adam rolls over,
pulling the covers off Barbara.  We see:

ON BARBARA -- she is hovering off the side of the bed.

An OMINOUS RUMBLE -- like a 4.0 earthquake shakes
the house.  GLASS RATTLES, the ceramic horses on the
mantelpiece jump around.  Barbara falls to the floor.
They look at one another with horror.  They leap up and
run downstairs.


INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

The RUMBLE BUILDS TO A CLIMAX, there is a LOUD METALLIC
SQUEAL, and then a CRASH... just as Barbara and Adam
arrive.


THE FRONT DOOR

smashes open revealing a moving van ramp.


A TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC-BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH

slides smoothly down the ramp.  On the couch sits DELIA
DEETZ.

The couch CRASHES into the base of the staircase,
smashing the newel post and several of the balusters.
Barbara cringes.  One of the balusters falls at Delia's
side.  She grasps it like a scepter.

Two MOVING MEN rush down the ramp.

MOVING MAN #1
Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.

DELIA
Don't worry.  It was going anyway.

Delia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion-
able, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured.

She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara
and Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale
image.

Delia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks
through Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there
(which to her eyes they're not).

Still holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch
and moves into the living room, surveying it with an
odd mixture of ambition, and resolution.


BEHIND HER

the two Moving Men bring in a matching blue leather
armchair.  In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ.

Lydia, age 14, is a pretty girl, but wan, pale and
overly-dramatic, dressed as she is in her favorite
color, black.  She's a combination of a little death
rocker and an 80's version of Edward Gorey's little
girls.

She has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck
-- and is already taking photographs of the moving
men.  Lydia is cool, Lydia is sullen, Lydia is her
father's daughter by his first marriage.  Lydia is
usually about half-pissed off.  But underneath... we
like her a lot.

The Moving Men still hold up the chair, waiting for
Delia to decide where she wants it.

DELIA
(continuing)
Jesus.  Who lived here?  The
Waltons?

TIGHT ON Lydia -- calmly surveys the house.

Delia signals wearily that the Moving Men can put the
chair down anywhere.

DELIA
(continuing)
Get all this other crap out of
here.

Lydia hops down out of the chair, and comes farther
into the living room.

DELIA
(continuing)
Where is your father?... probably
in the kitchen.

That's the cue for CHARLES DEETZ, who comes in through
the swinging door, and across the dining room... a ner-
vous but basically pleasant man, CHARLES DEETZ is
intent on attacking rest and relaxation with the same
vengeance that earned him millions in real estate.

CHARLES
The noise in that kitchen.  Noisy
refrigerator, noisy faucets...
We'll have to replace it all.  I
want no humming in the house.


LYDIA

exploring on her own, gazes around the living room with
growing pleasure, she backs up for a good angle to
photograph.

CAMERA HINGES -- She is standing with her back right up
to Barbara -- who is horrified at this creature.

Charles enters.

CHARLES
(to Lydia)
What do you think, honey?

LYDIA
Delia hates it.

Lydia gazes at a dusty maze of spider webs.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I could live here.

A movement makes Lydia turn around and scream.  It is
Delia.  Not Barbara.

DELIA
Settle down, Lydia.  I wonder
where we are going to get
counseling for you out here.

A VIOLENT FALSETTO SCREAM turns the Deetz family's
attention to the front windows.

OTHO (O.S.)
Help!  Oh help!


OTHO'S MASSIVE BODY

Wedged in the window frame.  The short, stubby legs,
dressed in the world's largest pair of Georgia Armani
slacks, protrude into the living room, waving fran-
tically.  Expensive Italian loafers are kicked off the
feet, revealing a pair of expensive patterned socks.
By their feet shall ye know them.

DELIA
It's Otho!

CHARLES
Otho, why didn't you just come in
the door?

Otho's voice comes as if from a great distance.

OTHO (O.S.)
It's bad luck.  And I believe
hugely in luck.

DELIA
Hold your breath and we'll pull.

Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't
get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room
single-handedly.

All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out
the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous
new furniture.

Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and
faggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer
carries nasty emotional weight as well.


OTHO

holds onto the curtains for support as he is pulled
through the window.  And when he is at last all the way
through, and upright on his feet, he suddenly gives a
tremendous yank.  The whole drapery apparatus,
including valences, crashes to the floor.

OTHO
That was the single most
unattractive window treatment I
have ever seen in the entire of my
existence.

DELIA
(starry eyed)
I'm so glad you could leave the
city to consult me, Otho.

Otho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet
horror.

OTHO
Yes, of course you are.  Well,
Otho had an intuition.  Call it a
hunch -- that it was going to be a
fabled monstrosity of a house.
And it certainly is.  Charles,
you're lucky the yuppies are
buying condos, so you can afford
what I'm going to have to do to
this place.  We are talking from
the ground ups'ville!

CHARLES
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me
out of it.  I am here to relax and
clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I
mean to do it.

He exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house.
During this speech, Otho has been surreptitiously pos-
ing for Lydia's camera.  She clicks the shutter.

OTHO
(ignoring her)
Is the rest of the house as bad as
this?

DELIA
The rest of the house is probably
worse.  When can you and I get
started?

OTHO
No time like the present, as my
wicked stepmother used to say.

Out of the pockets of his size 56 Georgia Armani
jacket, Otho takes two cans of spray paint -- the kind
the graffiti artists use -- and shakes them as if they
were castanets.  They certainly sound like it.

OTHO
Delia, let's get this show on the
road.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

At one end, near the stairs leading up to the attic,
Barbara and Adam are slumped against opposite walls.

BARBARA
Adam, we are in hell.  I hate
these people.

ADAM
They make Jane look good.

BARBARA
Is this a punishment for something
we did in life?  What can we do?

ADAM
(determined)
We're not completely helpless.
I've been reading the book.
There's a word for people in our
predicament, honey.

Barbara looks at him.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Ghosts!

Barbara is shocked at the reality.

Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the
hallway.

OTHO
We're dealing with negative
entertainment potential here.  I
mean, there's absolutely no organic
walking flow-through.

Otho looks down the hallway.  It's empty.  Adam and
Barbara are no longer there.

DELIA
What's wrong?

OTHO
I thought I saw something.

DeLia turns and spray-paints on the wall -- in luminous
orange -- the word MAUVE.

DELIA
Okay?

OTHO
(screaming with delight)
You read my mind!  I love clients
who can read my mind.  I don't
think people realize how strong a
connection there is between
interior design and the
supernatural.

DELIA
(fawning)
I know... I read your book, The
Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf.

OTHO
Gooood!

Delia opens the door and they step inside another room.

DELIA
This will be Lydia's room.


INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - DAY

It's not Lydia's room yet, of course, because it still
has the Maitlands' furniture in it.  Barbara had partly
wallpapered it before the accident.  Her tools are still
there.

DELIA
What do you think?

OTHO
Viridian?

DELIA
Viridian?  What is...?

Otho spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- plus
the word BLUE GREEN -- and Cr2 03, right over a picture
of Adam and Barbara as kids.

OTHO
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic
oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in
chemistry.  I was a hair analyst!
Briefly.  Interior design is a
science, Delia!  Think of me as
Doctor Otho.
(looking at wall)
And this patient is truly sick!

DELIA
Of course, her favorite color!
How beautiful!

Delia smiles.  Behind Delia and Otho, the room's closet
door swings slowly open with and ominous CREAK.


DELIA AND OTHO

turn that way, with a suggestion of dread.  Inside the
closet, Barbara's corpse is suspended from the ceiling
by a belt.  The corpse twists with a CREAK, and Barbara
grins ghostly -- and slowly tears off her face, leaving
nothing but muscle and bone beneath.  Her eyeballs
dangle on her cheeks.

Delia and Otho stare aghast.

DELIA
Oh my God!

OTHO
We just have to pray that the
other closets are bigger than this
one.

He walks over.  Looks inside.

OTHO
(continuing)
Were these people dwarfes? (sic)
(spies something)
Oooooo!...  Look!

He finds, neatly hung in plastic, the Maitlands'
wedding outfits.  Totally captivated by this powerful
image, he peers through the plastic at them.  Holding
each up to Delia.  Barbara watches wide-eyed at them.

OTHO
(continuing)
Ozzie...
(holding up
her dress)
... and... Harriet!  What happened
to these people?

Delia slams the door in Barbara's contorted face.

DELIA
They died.


INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

Delia and Otho come out of Lydia's bedroom and go
through the bathroom.  Disgusted, they continue on to
the study.


OTHO

reaches out and turns the knob.  The door swings omi-
nously open on Charles' study.  This had been Adam's
reading and birdwatching study.  Bird posters on the
wall, books everywhere.  Straight out of Better Homes
and Gardens 1963.

OTHO
Ooo.  Deliver me from L.L. Bean!


ANGLE

There is one slight difference, however, because on the
rag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adam's headless
corpse.  Standing over him, holding in one hand a long
knife and in the other Adam's blood-and-gore dripping
head is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face.
Behind them, Charles is thumbing through Adam's Audubon
collection.  He sits up like a cornered animal protect-
ing his territory.

CHARLES
(to Otho and Delia)
This room is off limits.  I don't
want either of you to touch one
piece of furniture in here.  This
is my room.


INSIDE THE ROOM

The eyes of Adam's severed head open and look up at
Barbara -- she stops screaming.

ADAM'S HEAD
They don't see us.  They can't
hear us.

Outside, Delia is shaking her head.

DELIA
The woman who lived here had the
aesthetic instincts of Betty
Crocker.

BARBARA
I'm going to get her.

DELIA
I cannot convey to you the extent
to which this house bores me.

OTHO
(looking around
scientifically)
Once you cover up the wallpaper,
knock down a few walls, alter the
traffic patterns, and -- perhaps
-- think about an inground pool --
the place might just be livable.
What's on the third floor?

DELIA
Attic space.

OTHO
Let's see.  We could turn that
into a media room.

They head up the stars to the attic.


INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Adam's head has a look of terror on it.

ADAM'S HEAD
Oh, God.  I forgot to lock the
attic door!

Adam's headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes
out of the room.


INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - SAME TIME

Otho and Delia climbing.  The headless corpse careens
past them, around the bend in the stairs and out of
sight.

OTHO
Did you"
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
feel something?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia shakes her head.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
I felt a cool wind.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The expression on Otho's face suggests he knows more,,,,,,
than he's telling.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. LANDING OUTSIDE ATTIC DOOR - SAME TIME,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The headless corpse rushes through the open door into,,,,,,
the attic.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The headless corpse slams the door shut, turns the key,,,,,
in the lock.  Then he slumps against the locked door in,,,,,,
an exaggerated stance of relief.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC LANDING - SAME TIME,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia tries the knob.  The door is locked.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
You don't have a key?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Maybe Charles does.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
I have a feeling there's some very,,,,,,
interesting space behind this,,,,,,
door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(sarcastic),,,,,,
Probably the world's largest,,,,,,
Reader's Digest collection!,,,,,,
C'mon, let's have some chablis,,,,,
Otho, I'm laid bare by this,,,,,
experience.  Entirely bare.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. STUDY - SAME TIME,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara still holding Adam's head.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles still calmly leafing through the Audubons.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM'S HEAD,,,,,,
Whew!  That was close.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
I cannot witness this.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara distractedly puts Adam's head on a bookshelf.,,,,,,
His headless body fumbles with the books and finally,,,,,,
reattaches the head.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. STUDY - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam turns away from the window.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara, fuming, moves around Charles making wild,,,,
gestures.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
What's the good of being a ghost,,,,,,
if you can't frighten people to,,,,,,
death?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Oh, honey...,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
No, I'm not putting up with this.,,,,,
,,,,,,
She storms out of the room.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara storms in, as if straight from the room up-,,,,,
stairs.  She heads straight for the back door.  Just as,,,,,,
she opens the door, Adam rushes up.,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Barbara, honey!  Don't go out,,,,,
there.  You don't know --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Nothing can be worse than this...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She flings open the door and steps outside.  She,,,,,,
promptly disappears.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Barbara!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT. SURFACE OF SATURN'S MOON TITAN - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara plunges into the dusty surface of Titan with an,,,,,,
enormous Saturn looming in the sky.  She looks around,,,,,,
with wonder and some fear.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A SULFUR VOLCANO,,,,,,
,,,,,,
erupts in the distance.  A meteor CRASHES with a lurid,,,,,,
EXPLOSION.  As from a great distance she hears Adam's,,,,,,
VOICE.  Like THUNDER.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Barbara!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She turns slowly in the yellow dense sand that covers,,,,,,
the surface of this distant moon.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA'S POV,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam is trudging towards her.  Behind him, hovering,,,,,
isolated in the air, is the kitchen door.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BACK TO SCENE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam at last catches up with her.  Surveys around them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Oh Adam.  Find somebody.  I'm,,,,,,
getting all yellow.  Do something!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BEHIND THEM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Something is burrowing rapidly toward them through the,,,,,,
"sand.  The Something could be right out of """"Dune"""".",,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA AND ADAM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
stare for a moment, then Adam grabs her and pulls her,,,,,
toward the kitchen door.  But the kitchen door has,,,,,,
moved, so they veer in the new direction.,,,,,
,,,,,,
The Something follows them and rises out of the sand.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON SOMETHING,,,,,,
,,,,,,
It is a very big, very nasty, and very hungry SNAPPING,,,,
SANDWORM.  It ROARS and lunges at them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
slightly angered at it, instinctively bats at it.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THE SANDWORM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
is momentarily stunned at Barbara's audacity.  It,,,,,,
freezes and shakes its loathesome head.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
bats at it again.  Adam is wide-eyed, tries to pull her,,,,,
away.  The Sandworm recovers and ROARS after them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
grabs Barbara and tries to escape, but they slip and,,,,,
sink in the sand.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They make it to the door just in time, swing it open,,,,,
and hurl themselves through.  The door shuts with a,,,,,,
BANG just in front of the ROARING SANDWORM.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THE SANDWORM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
rears and ROARS in frustration, HOWLING to the ringed,,,,,
planet.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. KITCHEN,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara, weeping, throws herself in Adam's arms.,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me,,,,
alone.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
You left me.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
I know.  I'm sorry.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She hugs him tight.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
I just realized that I could have,,,,,,
been killed alone.  Don't ever,,,,,,
leave me, honey.,,,,,
,,,,,,
Both contemplate that horror.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
We're trapped in this house,,,,,,
forever... with those... people.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
You can't say that for sure.  It,,,,,,
could be a transitional thing.,,,,,,
Like a post-life crisis.  We just,,,,,,
have to be tougher with them.,,,,,,
Come on.  Have some brandy.,,,,,,
Spirits?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(a tentative smile),,,,,,
Death didn't improve your sense of,,,,,,
humor.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They head for the dining room.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DINING ROOM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam has his arms around Barbara's shoulder.  They walk,,,,,,
in the door and stumble upon the Deetzes at their,,,,,,
dinner.  Lydia's back is to them.  Barbara and Adam,,,,,,
back out of the room but stop to listen.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The Deetz's around the dining room table.  There are,,,,,,
candles and good china laid out-- but they're eating,,,,,,
out of Chinese take-out boxes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
I can't believe that we're eating,,,,,,
Cantonese.  Is there no Szechuan,,,,,,
up here?  Hunan?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
There's only one Chinese,,,,,,
restaurant out here, darling, the,,,,
owners are Irish and Irish people,,,,,,
happen to cook Cantonese.  They,,,,,,
don't know better.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I plan to have a stroke from the,,,,,,
amount of MSG that's in this food.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
This is our first meal in this,,,,,,
house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do,,,,,
our little private parts to make,,,,,,
it a pleasant one?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a,,,,,
darkroom in the basement.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(dramatically),,,,,,
My whole life is a darkroom!,,,,,,
One... big... dark... room.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia rolls her eyes and nods.  She's been through this,,,,,,
before.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Nonsense... you'll go to school,,,,,,
maybe meet a farm boy.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia laughs.  Charles smiles.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(doleful),,,,,,
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll,,,,
let me hang myself from a rope in,,,,,,
his barn.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Lydia, in a couple of years this,,,,,
whole town will be filled with,,,,,,
people like us.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
We'll be the art center of summer,,,,,,
New York.  I'll start sculpting,,,,,,
again... I'll teach those gallery,,,,,,
bastards to refuse my sculpture.,,,,,,
And when Otho and I get through,,,,,,
with this house, you people are,,,,,
not going to recognize it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(dramatically),,,,,,
I say let's keep it the way it is.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia stares at Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(smiles),,,,,,
Good idea!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia shifts her glare to Charles.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I do.  I really like it.  I,,,,,,
mean, it's already sort of like,,,,,
somebody's home, isn't it?  Their,,,,,
couch is comfortable and doesn't,,,,,,
stick to your legs.  It smells,,,,,,
like a real home, not a French,,,,,
whorehouse.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Lydia, at your age, you are so,,,,
young.,,,,,,
(back to business),,,,,,
Charles, we need to call that,,,,,
awful Jane Butterfield tomorrow,,,,,,
and get the key to the attic door.,,,,,,
Can't you find a way to hold back,,,,,,
some of her commission?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
We're going to have a lot to do,,,,,,
tomorrow...,,,,,,
The Goodwill truck is coming.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
... and whatever is up there in,,,,,,
that attic goes away with it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Should have it fumigated, too.  I,,,,,
saw a fly today.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia looks at them with a mixture of sadness and,,,,,,
anger.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OUTSIDE THE DOOR - ON THE STAIRS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
#NAME?, sit Barbara and Adam.  A tear rolls down,,,,,
her face.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara are lying down on the floor, peering,,,,,
out of one of the small windows overlooking the front,,,,,,
yard of the house.  The handbook open in front of them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT. FRONT YARD - ADAM AND BARBARA'S POV - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The entire front yard is alive with workmen and their,,,,,,
vehicles.  Plumbers, electricians, cable TV men, etc.,,,
In the road on front of the house are several cars of,,,,,,
rubbernecking locals, astonished by all the activity.,,,,,
The City has come to Town.  Moving men continue to move,,,,,,
in the Deetz' modern, expensive and ugly furniture.,,,,,
They collide with Goodwill men coming out with the,,,,,,
Maitlands' lovely antiques and personal possessions.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara just look at one another as if to say,,,,,,
"We're next!""""  Adam leafs through the handbook furi-",,,,,,
ously.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Look in the index...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Not really...  what's this?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam pulls from the book an ancient, yellowed,,,,,
crumbling handbill.  He carefully opens it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON handbill -- very primitive, crude, red printing.,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM (V.O.),,,,,,
(reading),,,,,,
Having difficulty adjusting?,,,,,,
Is death a problem and not a,,,,,,
solution?  Unhappy with eternity?,,,,,,
Troubled by the living?  Call,,,,,,
Betelgeuse, the bio-exorcist.,,,,,
That's Betelgeuse,  Betel...,,,,,
,,,,,,
The remainder of the sheet is torn off.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON Barbara -- fingering the torn edge.  Looking in the,,,,,,
book for the remainder.  No luck.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
That's it?  No number, or,,,,,
instructions?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Nothing.  The bio-exorcist?  I,,,,,,
don't get it...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. KITCHEN,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles, away from the chaos outside is calmly steeping,,,,,
a mug of herb tea.  His solitude is interrupted by a,,,,,,
2500 lb. Vulcan range breaking through a too-small,,,,,,
kitchen window.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(shouting through,,,,,,
the window),,,,,,
What the hell are you trying to do,,,,,,
out there?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA - OUTSIDE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
is berating the inept crane operator and shrieks,,,,,,
periodically at some fine art movers who are struggling,,,,,,
under her horrid modern welded steel sculptures.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
snaps photos of the mayhem.  She stops to scan the whole,,,,,,
house.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA'S POV,,,,,,
,,,,,,
When her gaze reaches to top of the house, she suddenly,,,,,
glimpses Barbara and Adam's faces in the window.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BACK TO SCENE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia blinks hard.  Her mouth drops open.  She looks,,,,,,
all around -- as if she'd just seen a ghost or two.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JANE BUTTERFIELD'S CAR,,,,,,
,,,,,,
pulls up.  Little Jane sits in the front seat, burdened,,,,,
with an enormous stack of collated and stapled copies.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia catches sight of Jane and runs over.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Little Jane locks her door, in fear of Lydia-the,,,,,
strange.  Lydia stares at her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LITTLE JANE,,,,,,
Are you a boy or a girl?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I only speak to vertebrates.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
What happened to the people who,,,,,,
used to live here?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LITTLE JANE,,,,,,
(ratty little voice),,,,,,
They drowned!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JANE,,,,,,
Yes, they were family.  I was,,,,,
devastated.,,,,,,
(beat),,,,,,
Here, darling.,,,,,
,,,,,,
Jane hands a key to Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(impressed),,,,,,
Is this the key to the attic?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JANE,,,,,,
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open,,,,,,
any door in that house.  Will you,,,,,,
give it to your father?,,,,,,
(handing her a,,,,,,
business card),,,,,,
And you might mention that I,,,,,,
single-handedly decorated the,,,,,,
house.  In case he needs advice in,,,,,,
that area.  Come see me.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Jane goes away.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANOTHER ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia's face sobers as she looks up at the now empty,,,,,,
attic window.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA (O.S.),,,,,,
Help!  Get off me!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia drops the skeleton key into her pocket surrepti-,,,,,,
tiously.  She follows Delia's SHRIEKING.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT. HOUSE - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia rounds the corner to see Delia, pinned flat,,,,,
against the house by one of her horrid steel sculp-,,,,,,
tures.  Two movers are struggling to free her.  Lydia,,,,,,
snaps a quick photograph.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They finally free Delia.  She clutches at her head,,,,,,
just short of tearing her hair out.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
You jerks!  That is my art, and it,,,,,
is dangerous!  You think I want to,,,,,,
want to die like that?,,,,,,
(seeing Lydia),,,,,,
Lydia.  Moving is a family affair.,,,,,,
So buckle down now and go get,,,,,,
Mommy some drugs.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Any particular kind?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Joke!  Joke!  Aspirin!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia walks off toward the house.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara is half-hiding on the edge of the window.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
That little girl saw us.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
She couldn't have.  We can't make,,,,,,
them see us.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
But she saw us.  I could feel it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(pause, thinking,,,,,
that over),,,,,,
That's all we need.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia looks up the stairs at the attic landing.  She's,,,,,,
a little scared.  She decides to go up the dark stairs.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
IN THE HALL,,,,,,
,,,,,,
At the end of the hall stands Charles, directing men,,,,,
who are carrying books into the room that will be his,,,,,,
study.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He continues on.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A BLAST of STEAM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
fills the hallway, because workmen are already going at,,,,,
the wallpaper.  Lydia emerges from it.  Looking up at,,,,,,
stairway to attic, mounting courage.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia creeps upward, taking the skeleton key from her,,,,,
pocket.  FLOORBOARDS SQUEAK.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam works on his model.  He hears the SQUEAK, looks up,,,,,
confidently.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(whispering),,,,,,
Don't worry.  I've locked it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara smiles and knits while rocking in her chair.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC LANDING,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia quietly inserts the key in the lock of the attic,,,,,,
door.  She turns it.  The key is stiff.  She turns,,,,,,
harder.  It's stuck.  Lydia tries the door -- it's no,,,,,,
go.  She turns the key again.  This time it goes all,,,,,,
the way around.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam, surprised by the key, look at each,,,,
other, carefully, very quietly, stand up and tiptoe,,,
toward door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON THE SCREEN OF AN OLD TV SET,,,,,,
,,,,,,
in the corner of the attic -- Suddenly -- a ghostly,,,,,,
image POPS ON.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON TV - A BIZARRE, SMALLISH FELLOW,,,,,
,,,,,,
outfitted in a too-big cowboy hat, bad wig, and over-,,,,
sized sunglasses appears on screen singing very,,,,,,
quickly.  (It's a heavily disguised BETELGEUSE.),,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BEHIND HIM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
the CAMERA QUICKLY PANS an assortment of tombstones a,,,,,,
la Cal Worthington.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(singing),,,,,,
Have the living got you down?,,,,,,
Betelgeuse!,,,,,,
Are they jacking you around?,,,,,,
Betelgeuse!,,,,,,
Have you broken out in hives,,,,,,
'Cause you're tired of their jive?,,,,,,
I will drive them from your,,,,,,
hive... Betelgeuse!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANOTHER ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CAMERA TILTS DOWN a flashing tombstone with,,,,,,
"BETELGEUSE"""" written on it.  Adam rushes over to shut",,,,,,
it off.  He can't find a plug.  He looks around behind,,,,,,
set... no workings inside at all.  He peers around to,,,,,,
the screen.  It is blank.  Suddenly -- Betelgeuse POPS,,,,,,
ON AGAIN.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Say it once... Betelgeuse,,,,,,
Say it twice... Betelgeuse.,,,,,,
The third time's a charm...,,,,,,
Betelgeuse!,,,,,,
Come on down!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He POPS OFF.  Adam and Barbara stare at each other.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. LANDING - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia listens.  Did she hear something?  She puts her,,,,,,
hand on the knob and tries to turn it.  It's stuck.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Then the key eerily pops out of the lock and falls on,,,,,,
the floor.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles' head suddenly appears behind her.  Scares her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
What are you doing?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam is holding on tight to the knob of the door.  With,,,,,,
her knitting needle, Barbara has poked the key out.,,,,,
,,,,,,
The two stand absolutely still, listening, terrified of,,,,
the living intruders.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC LANDING - LYDIA AND CHARLES,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I was just trying to open the,,,,,,
door.  Mrs. Butterfield brought,,,,,,
over a skeleton key.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Let me have it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam tighten.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON THE LANDING,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
But it doesn't work.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She hands her father the key.  He looks at it and,,,,,,
throws it in the corner.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway,,,,,,
this can wait.  We'll get a,,,,,,
crowbar later.  Where's your,,,,,,
mother?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(very quick de-,,,,,,
cisive delivery),,,,,,
Stepmother.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
I'm going down to relax.  I want a,,,,,,
noise-free zone.  Do you,,,,,,
understand?  Noise-free.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He goes down the stairs.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Dad?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He continues.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(irritated, over,,,,,
his shoulder),,,,,,
What?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I'm lonely.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A BLAST OF STEAM from below drowns out her words.,,,,,,
Charles stops and turns around.  The BLAST STOPS.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
What?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
TIGHT ON LYDIA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She is resolved.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Nothing.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles continues.  She begins to follow slowly.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON KEY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
behind Lydia.  WIDEN as Adam rushes out the door, grabs,,,,,
the key and rushes back in again.  Lydia hears some-,,,,,,
thing but doesn't see.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam have moved away from the door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(looking through,,,,,,
the handbook),,,,,,
We need some help.  I found,,,,,,
something this morning.  Here.,,,,,,
Emergencies.,,,,,,
(reads),,,,,,
In case of emergency," draw door.""""",,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Draw door?  I don't know why we,,,,,,
keep looking in that stupid book.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam takes a piece of chalk and draws a little door on,,,,,,
the exposed brick of the chimney.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
You don't actually think this,,,,,,
is going to work?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam draws a doorknob.  Then he tries to turn it.  The,,,,,,
door, perhaps to his surprise, fails to open.,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Yet another triumph for Adam and,,,,,,
Barbara in the afterlife.  Why,,,,,,
don't we try this Beetle guy??...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Wait.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He looks at book, then writes on the door:  KNOCK AND,,,,,
ENTER.  He exchanges a glance with Barbara.  She's even,,,,,,
more skeptical than before.  Turns away in disgust.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam knocks on the door, and turns the knob.  Nothing.,,,,,
She is more disgusted.  Adam goes back to the book.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Aha!  Knock three times.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANOTHER ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He knocks three times.  Turns knob.  The chalked door,,,,,,
swings magnificently open.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Behind is an eerie light source, SOARING MUSIC, maybe,,,,
even a heavenly choir singing pear-shaped syllables.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam look at one another again.  They hold,,,,,,
hands and step tentatively through.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Their figures are lost in the blinding light.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They start to shut door after them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON THE ATTIC LANDING,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia is staring at the light pouring from under the,,,,,,
attic door.  It suddenly goes out.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON LYDIA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She is dumbfounded.  She listens.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON THE LANDING,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia speeds down the steps.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. CHARLES' STUDY - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles, fiercely intent on relaxing, paces like a,,,,
catfish out of water.  Ralph Lauren in K-mart.  He,,,,,,
stretches.  He sits uneasily in an easy chair, tries,,,,,
like hell to get comfortable.  Finally, he puts a book,,,,,
under his bottom to get sitting straight.  Looks around,,,,,,
tapping his fingers.  What to do?  Looks at watch.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He takes down a book from Adam's library, it is an,,,,,
Audubon book of birds.  He whips through it like it's,,,,,,
the comics and then looks around for more.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"He finds the """"Illustrated Walden"""" by Thoreau.  He",,,,,,
speed reads it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He is now really bored.  Goes to the fireplace, tries,,,,,
to light it.  Cannot do it.  Goes to desk and writes:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO-INSTALL GAS FIRE LOGS IN,,,,,,
STUDY.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He studies bird posters.  Finds beautiful cardinal,,,,,,
picture.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Takes field glasses and looks out window.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
HIS POV,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Spies big ugly-looking ratty bird devouring something.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON CHARLES,,,,,,
,,,,,,
horrified.  Wrinkles his nose.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia enters.  He jumps.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Jesus Christ!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia is shocked.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Darling, can't you see I'm,,,,,
relaxing in here!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Well I just wanted to tell you,,,,,,
what I saw.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Lydia.  What the hell is the point,,,,,,
of my moving up here if you people,,,,,,
won't let me relax?  Go help your,,,,,,
mother.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles returns to field glasses, spies something.  She,,,,,
looks at him in frustration.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(on her way out),,,,,,
Fine.  Maybe you can relax in a,,,,,,
haunted house.  But I can't.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She exits.  Charles peers after her, brow furrowed.,,,,,
Looks out again at the village.  Uses his field glasses,,,,,,
to get a better look.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
HIS POV,,,,,,
,,,,,,
It is the Bozman Building.  Ernie is out front pol-,,,,,,
ishing the brass lion.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON CHARLES,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He thinks.  Moves the field glasses to punctuate his,,,,,,
discovery of the building.  (His eyes never leave field,,,,,,
glasses throughout the following.),,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Nice building... Bad paint.  Good,,,,,,
lines... bad roof.  Good,,,,,,
parking... hmmm???,,,,,,
,,,,,,
That really registers with him.  Without looking, he,,,,,
dials a familiar number on the phone with one hand,,,,,,
lifts the receiver.  He clacks his teeth together pur-,,,,,,
posefully.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
SECRETARY'S VOICE,,,,,,
Botco International.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Yes, I'd like to speak with Maxie,,,,,
Dean.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
SECRETARY'S VOICE,,,,,,
He's not in right now.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Well tell him that Charles Deetz,,,,,,
called.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He hangs up and continues to spy on Bozman Building.,,,,,,
Clacks his teeth.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
My God what I could do with that,,,,,,
parking.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DISSOLVE TO:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
TIGHT SHOT - BARBARA AND ADAM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Very still, they look cautiously to the right and left,,,,,
-- just with their eyes.  They're astounded by what,,,,,,
they see, though we don't yet see it.,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
... Not what I expected when we,,,,,,
walked through that door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
No. But it's somewhere without big,,,,,,
worms.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CAMERA DRAWS BACK and we find that Adam and Barbara are,,,,,,
in:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The most unpleasant waiting room that you ever remember,,,,,,
waiting in.  Fifties furniture with broken legs,,,,,,
couches propped up on telephone books.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Standing ashtrays with dirty stand.  Linoleum floors,,,,,,
patched a hundred times.  National Geographics with the,,,,,,
"covers torn off.  The """"Take a number"""" registers in the",,,,,,
millions.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
AS THE CAMERA COMPLETES A CIRCLE OF THE ROOM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
We see a RECEPTIONIST.  She's the quintessential 50's,,,,,,
receptionist -- tight sweater, bullet-breasted bra,,,,,
bleached hair, red lipstick.  She's wearing a ribbon,,,,,
"across her breast reading """"MISS ARGENTINA"""" and there",,,,,,
are knife slashes across both wrists.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
You don't have an appointment, do,,,,,
you?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
W... We didn't know how to make one.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
An appointment for what?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
What do you want?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
We need some help.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
Already?  You just bit the big one,,,,,,
nine months ago and you want help?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Nine months?  What difference does,,,,,,
that make?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
(shrugging),,,,,,
Good luck.  You're going to use up,,,,,,
all your help vouchers.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Help vouchers?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
D-90's.  You spend a hundred,,,,,,
and twenty-five years on earth,,,,,,
actually, in that house, during,,,,
which you get only three class-one,,,,,,
D-90 intercessions with Juno.  You,,,,,,
probably haven't even read through,,,,,,
the manual completely yet.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Why three?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
TYPIST,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Behind the Receptionist holds up both hands each of,,,,,,
which have only three fingers on them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
TYPIST,,,,,,
Rule Number Three.  Everything,,,,,,
comes in threes...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
You'll have to wait if you don't,,,,,,
have an appointment.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
How long do we have to wait?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Wait for who?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
For Juno, your caseworker.  Not,,,,,
that it matters to your type.  But,,,,,,
there are all these other people,,,,,,
here ahead of you.  I'd say 3,,,,,,
hours.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The waiting room is now filled with people.  Dead,,,,,,
people, some in fairly awful states.  A cornucopia of,,,,,
carnal shreddage.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara look around for a moment, then very,,,,,
quietly, they reach out to grasp hands.,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Number 54 million, six hundred,,,,,
one.  Ferndock.,,,,,,

INT. ATTIC LANDING - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia kneels down with a screwdriver, a nail file, an,,,,
ice pick, and a credit card.  She inserts nail file,,,,,
into the door.  She struggles, and after several,,,,,
attempts -- finally uses the ice pick and POP!  The,,,,,,
door swings open ominously.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia enters.  The room is dim, and filled with dust,,,,,
motes.  There are shadows in all the corners.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She bumps into a switch which engages the model sun and,,,,,,
moon and that eerily illuminates the model town.  She's,,,,,,
frightened, then entranced.,,,,,
,,,,,,
She peers at it from different angles, her fear for-,,,,,
gotten.  She notes small tools scattered around an,,,,,,
unfinished area.  She continues around the model,,,,,,
oblivious to everything else.  Then...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She kicks something.  Ducks under the table and comes,,,,,,
up with something, holds it up to the light.  It's the,,,,,
handbook.  She looks through it.  Finds the marked,,,,,,
page... looks at the chalk door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. OFFICE - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam are still holding hands, as if they,,,,,
hadn't moved.  Like waiting for an IRS audit.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(to Adam),,,,,,
Is this what happens when you die?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The Receptionist overhears.  She points at Barbara.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
This is what happens when YOU die.,,,,,,
(points to another,,,,,,
corpse),,,,,,
That is what happens when HE dies.,,,,,,
That is what happens when THEY,,,,,,
die.  It's highly personal.  And,,,,,,
I'll tell you something... if I,,,,,,
knew then what I know now... I,,,,,,
wouldn't have had my little,,,,,,
"accident!""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
She holds up her wrists and smiling at her little joke,,,,,,
wriggles them indicating her slashes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHER CORPSES,,,,,,
(all together),,,,,,
Amen!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam look at them.  Corpses resume doing,,,,,,
what they were doing.  A GRINDING NOISE O.S. -- The,,,,,,
Receptionist looks up.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam also look O.S.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THEIR POV,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A Message delivery wire GRINDS along loudly on a,,,,,,
pulley.  The actual message is held in the hand of the,,,,,,
MESSENGER, a flattened corpse, suspended as if on a,,,,
shirt clothesline, tire marks on his face and clothing.,,,,,
A major roadkill.  Dust and gravel ground into him.  He,,,,,,
smiles wanly at Barbara and Adam as the Receptionist,,,,,,
takes a message on a piece of paper and reads it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
Maitland, party of two!  Take your,,,,,
handbook and go to the sixth door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam upset at the loss of their handbook...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
We forgot our handbook.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CUT TO:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia is studying the handbook with intense interest.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES (O.S.),,,,,,
(from distant,,,,,,
downstairs),,,,,,
Lydia, Delia needs your help!,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia gives one more look at the book, and then goes to,,,,,
the door quickly and silently.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES (O.S.),,,,,,
Right now, Delia says!,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. OFFICE - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
(shaking her head,,,,,,
in disgust),,,,,,
Out that way, through the typing,,,,,
pool, down the corridor, sixth,,,,
door on your left.  Sixth door.,,,,,,
Two threes.,,,,,,
(shaking her head),,,,,,
Airhead.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara walk through a door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. TYPING POOL - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A vast room of desks arranged in a grid, straight,,,,,
"out of """"How To Succeed In Business""""... Each desk is",,,,,,
occupied, too, but most of the secretaries are merely,,,,
skeletons, or mouldering corpses slumped over their,,,,,
typewriters.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Only one secretary, somewhere in the vast grid, is,,,,
typing slowly, with long pauses between words.,,,,,
,,,,,,
The Messenger on his return trip, parallels Barbara and,,,,,
Adam as they walk along.  Barbara can't look at him.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
MESSENGER,,,,,,
How do I look?  There're no,,,,,,
mirrors on this side.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(trying to be,,,,,,
pleasant),,,,,,
Fine, you look fine.,,,,,
,,,,,,
MESSENGER,,,,,,
Thanks.  I've been feeling a,,,,,,
little flat.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANOTHER ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He laughs at his own joke as he goes back through the,,,,,,
very, very narrow slot in the wall where the line,,,,,
runs.  Adam and Barbara look to the right and left.,,,,,,
A vast stack of files slips off a desk and spills out,,,,,,
onto the floor.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam enter corridor.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Empty, like a hotel corridor, but all the doors are of,,,,
different types -- a revolving door, a dutch door,,,,,
church doors.  They walk past a waist-high window,,,,,,
covered by a roll-up shade.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
A hundred twenty-five years!,,,,,,
I can't believe it.  I can't,,,,,,
believe they didn't tell us.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She bumps into the shade and it rolls up FLAPPING.  She,,,,,,
stares in through the window.  Adam peers in it too.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THEIR POV,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A smouldering, mist-filled room.  From the smoky plasma,,,,,
floats an occasional tortured soul.  Unspeakably SAD,,,,,,
MUSIC wafts from within.  They get only a glimpse of,,,,,,
the bodies in this horrible human soup.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Adam, look at this.,,,,,
,,,,,,
Suddenly, floating up from below, immediately on the,,,,
other side of the window, a white-crepe face emerges.,,,,,
It seems to be that of a woman, her eyes are red and,,,,,
blue tears rim them.  Her pale skin is covered with a,,,,,,
flaking crust of salt.  She wears the saddest look,,,,,,
ever.  Her mouth opens plaintively but no sound comes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Oh, Adam... what is this?,,,,,
,,,,,,
A reflection joins them on their side of the window.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A SINISTER LITTLE JANITOR,,,,,,
,,,,,,
wizened and efficient, pulls the shade down firmly.,,,,,
,,,,,,
SINISTER MAN,,,,,,
That's the lost souls room.,,,,,,
A room for ghosts who have been,,,,,,
exorcised.  Poor devils.  That's,,,,,,
death for the dead.  It's all in,,,,,,
the handbook.  Keep moving.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The man scuttles off.  Adam and Barbara walk on sadly,,,,,,
until they come to a door that looks exactly like the,,,,,,
swinging door between the kitchen and dining room of,,,,,,
their house.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
This is it... the sixth door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Puzzled -- Barbara pushes it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Everything is dark, quiet -- but the furniture is,,,,,
obviously not theirs, and neither is the decoration.,,,,,
Adam and Barbara exchange glances, and push on through,,,,,
into the living room.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Quiet, dark.  Everyone's asleep.,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
My God, we're back home.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Look at this, everything is,,,,,
different down here.  All our,,,,,,
furniture is gone.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
How long do you suppose we were,,,,,,
waiting?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
Three months.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANOTHER ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A spot comes on, revealing JUNO -- their caseworker.,,,,,
She's an older woman, no nonsense about her.  Over-,,,,,
dressed in an outfit that includes a blouse with,,,,,,
ruffled cuffs.  We will at some point catch a glimpse,,,,,,
of her slashed throat -- she smokes heavily.  Occa-,,,,,,
sionaly smoke puffs from her cut throat.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
I'd nearly given up on you.  I was,,,,,,
about to leave.  I do have other,,,,,,
clients.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Are you Juno, our caseworker?,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
Yes.  I evaluate individual cases,,,,,,
and determine if help is needed,,,,,,
deserved, and available.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
We need help.  We deserve help.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Are you available?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
No.,,,,,,
(beat),,,,,,
What's wrong?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
We're very unhappy.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
What do you expect?  You're dead.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
We'd like some help in getting rid,,,,,,
of the people who moved in here.,,,,,,
Barbara and I worked very hard on,,,,,,
this house.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
We probably wouldn't mind sharing,,,,,,
the house with people who were --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Yes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
But these people --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He indicates a particularly bad piece of Delia's sculp-,,,,,,
ture.  Juno walks around it shaking her head.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. HOUSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The following conversation takes place as Barbara and,,,,,,
Adam follow Juno as she looks around the house and ends,,,,,,
up in their attic space.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
Things seem pretty quiet here.,,,,,,
You should thank God you didn't,,,,,,
die in Italy.,,,,,,
(checking the file),,,,,,
The Deetzes.  Okay.  Have you been,,,,,,
studying the manual?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
We tried.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
The Intermediate Interface chapter,,,,,,
on Haunting says it all.  Get 'em,,,,,,
out yourself.  It's your house.,,,,,,
Haunted houses don't come easy.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
We don't quite get it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Juno's watch BUZZES, she stops it.,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
I heard.,,,,,,
(refers to her file),,,,,,
Tore your face right off!  Bad,,,,,,
news.  It obviously doesn't do,,,,,,
any good to pull your heads off in,,,,,,
front of people if they can't see,,,,,,
you.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
We have to start simpler, is that,,,,,
it?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
Start simply.  Do what you know.,,,,,,
Use your talents.  Practice.  We,,,,,,
only help those who help,,,,,,
themselves.  Just do a little at a,,,,,,
time.  And of course, practice,,,,,
practice, practice.  It's tricky,,,,,
but -- you weren't murderers by,,,,,,
any chance, were you?,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
No.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
Pity.  Murderers seem to have an,,,,,,
easy time of it.  Just look at,,,,,,
Amityville.,,,,,,
(reminiscing),,,,,,
He was one of my boys.  Didn't,,,,,,
have to give that one any lessons.,,,,,,
From day one... But I must be,,,,,,
off... I've got a plane load of,,,,,,
football players crashed in the,,,,,,
midwest... they need a lot of,,,,,,
help, just with the basics.,,,,,
,,,,,,
Points at her head indicating dumbness.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
If... we have trouble.  What about,,,,,,
the guy in the flyer?  Betelge...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
(quickly interrupt-,,,,,,
ing her),,,,,,
Don't say his name, you don't want,,,,,
his help.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Puzzled.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM & BARBARA,,,,,,
Well... We might...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Juno peers into the model cemetery with interest.  A,,,,,,
FLY BUZZES around her.  Juno blows it away.  Fly flees.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
No you don't!  He does not work,,,,,,
well with others.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
What do you mean?  What's he do?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A grave look comes over Juno's face as the light,,,,,,
changes to suggest someone telling a ghost story around,,,,,,
a campfire.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
I wasn't going to bring it up --,,,,,,
but rather than have you stumble,,,,,,
into it and make another mistake,,,,,,
I'll tell you --,,,,,,
(she nervously puffs,,,,,,
her cigarette),,,,,,
He was my assistant, but he was a,,,,,
troublemaker...,,,,,,
He went out on his own as a free-,,,,,,
lance bio-exorcist -- claims to,,,,,,
get rid of the living... got into,,,,,,
more trouble -- you remember the,,,,,,
Chicago Fire...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara look at each other.  Juno continues.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
He was demoted to a Grade-6,,,,,,
malevolent spirit.  He's been,,,,,,
imprisoned on that plane ever,,,,,,
since... in fact, I believe he's,,,,,
been sleezing around your cemetery,,,,,,
lately.  He can only be brought,,,,,,
back by saying his name three,,,,,,
times.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara attempt to interrupt --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
But I strongly suggest that you,,,,,,
remove the Deetz's yourself.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She takes a final drag on the cigarette and smoke,,,,,,
billows out the hole in her throat.  Juno starts to,,,,,,
FADE.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
And if we need you again, how do,,,,,
we...?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Juno fades.  Gone.  Barbara goes to the model, looks,,,,,
at the cemetery.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
That guy is in our cemetery.  Oh,,,,,,
Adam.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(holds her shoul-,,,,,,
ders, calms her),,,,,
Look, she's right.  We'll just,,,,,
start simple, honey, be tougher.,,,,
I feel... confident.  C'mon.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They exit.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CAMERA FOLLOWS ACTION - OVER THE MODEL,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The FLY BUZZES.  It lands and crawls along into the model of,,,,,,
the cemetery.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THE FLY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
resplendently green and iridescent, pauses and fiddles,,,,,
with its hairy parts.  Starts to walk by.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
VOICE,,,,,,
Pssstt!  Over here!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Fly stops.  Tilts its multi-eyed head.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANOTHER ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Two hands come up from the earth of that grave holding,,,,,,
a candy bar.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
VOICE,,,,,,
I can't use this.  You should have,,,,,,
it.  Flies get so little respect,,,,,,
anymore.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THE FLATTERED FLY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
walks over to the grave.  In a flash, the hands grab,,,,,
the struggling fly and dance it like a doll over the,,,,,,
grave and then pull it into the earth.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
FLY,,,,,,
Buzzz!,,,,,,
(turns into),,,,,,
Help me!  Help me!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A MANIACAL LAUGH grows from the grave.  WIND BLOWS as,,,,,,
the Fly disappears.  Ivy whips away from the grave-,,,,,,
stone.  We see, for the first time, the chiseled name:,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CLAP OF THUNDER.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles is on the phone.  He has drawings laid out in,,,,,,
front of him.  He is at his most urban persuasive, and,,,,,
oddly relaxed -- he is finally in his own element.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Maxie, have I not always made you,,,,,
money?  I think that is the only,,,,,,
real question here.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. MAXIE'S OFFICE - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
New York office, cool design, black couch, and MAXIE,,,
DEAN, a 55-year-old, super tan, white-haired wheeler,,,
dealer.  Sign says:  CHAIRMAN of BOTCO INDUSTRIES.,,,,,,
Maxie looks rich and he looks cool as he talks to,,,,,,
Charles.  Behind him, Sarah, his rich-looking blonde,,,,
wife, is looking at herself in a mirror.,,,,,
,,,,,,
MAXIE,,,,,,
Well, Charles -- no one has made me,,,,,
money like you.  Until your nerves,,,,,,
went, you were a demon.  It is,,,,,
just that... Winter River,,,,,,
Connecticut is, you'll forgive me,,,,,
no fucking where.  Why would I,,,,,,
invest that kind of money to buy,,,,,,
an old building way the hell up,,,,,,
there?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INTERCUT CONVERSATION,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Not a building!  That's the beauty,,,,,,
of it.  I think I can buy the,,,,,,
whole town.  These people don't,,,,,,
know the value of their property!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
MAXIE,,,,,,
Then we own a whole town full of,,,,,,
nowhere.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
No, No -- C'mon, Max, you know,,,
me.  I've got plans.  You gotta,,,,,,
come up here and see, then I'll,,,,,
tell you about it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Maxie isn't much interested.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
MAXIE,,,,,,
Well, sure, Charles, but I am busy,,,
here... you know how it was when,,,,,,
you were active.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
This burns Charles.  But he swallows it.  He hears,,,,,,
something in the corridor outside -- a kind of LOW,,,,,,
MOANING.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(into telephone),,,,,,
Just a minute, Maxie.  Somebody.,,,,,
,,,,,,
MAXIE,,,,,,
No listen... we'll talk about,,,,,,
this visiting later, I gotta go,,,,,
I gotta meeting on the Japanese,,,,,,
joint venture.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(torn between the,,,,,,
MOANING and Maxie),,,,,,
Great idea, Maxie!  Those Japanese,,,,,
could run it for us.  Listen,,,,,,
think right about it, will you?,,,,,
We've almost got the house ready,,,,,,
you bring Sarah with you and I'll,,,,,,
show you.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
MAXIE,,,,,,
Yeah yeah, we'll think on it.,,,,,
Bye ya, Charles.  You relax up,,,,,
there, ya hear?,,,,,
,,,,,,
Maxie hangs up.  Shakes his head.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
MAXIE,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Putz!  Inter River?  My ass.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. CHARLES' STUDY - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles hangs up frustrated.  MOANING INCREASES.  He,,,,,,
goes to the door and flings it open.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A figure is right there in the doorway -- A ghost under,,,,,,
"a sheet.  But a """"designer"""" sheet.  He wails away like a",,,,,,
banshee.  Eyeholes cut in sheets, Charles jumps, re-,,,,
covers.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Oh, Jesus, Lydia!  Is Connecticut,,,,
so boring that you have to think,,,,,,
up shit like this?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON Barbara, she stands back away from the door observ-,,,,,
ing skeptically.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
I had Maxie Dean on the phone!,,,,,,
Darling, Dad's found a way to make,,,,,
some money here while I relax, so,,,,,
scram!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He slams the door, turns around.  Then turns around,,,,,
again, and jerks the door open.  The ghost is retreat-,,,,,
ing, beaten.,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
And your mother is going to kill,,,,,,
you when she sees that you cut,,,,,,
holes in her $300 sheets.  You,,,,,,
provoke her you know.  I mean she,,,,,,
can be an unreasonable bitch.  But,,,,,,
you do provoke her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He SLAMS the door again.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam helps Barbara on with her sheet.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
God, this is so corny.  Have we,,,,,
been reduced to this?  Sheets?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Think of them as death shrouds.,,,,,,
And the moaning is important.,,,,,,
Really moan!,,,,,,
(imitating Juno),,,,,,
Practice, practice, practice.,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Television still going, Delia asleep with curlers.,,,,,
Adam and Barbara glide inside, go over and stand beside,,,,,
the bed.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Deep breath... and...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She has her ever-present camera around her neck.  Sud-,,,,,,
denly hears MOANS from her parents' room.  Thinking it,,,,,,
is sexual, she cringes.  Covers her ears.,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Gross!  How can he stand that,,,,,,
woman?,,,,,,
(louder),,,,,,
Hey, cut it out!  I'm a child!,,,,,
For God sakes!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The NOISE gets weirder.  Lydia gets interested.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara moan and groan.  Delia doesn't stir.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
I feel really stupid.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
It's not stupid.  We're ghosts.,,,,,,
Do you want this woman for,,,,,,
breakfast for 125 years?  Moan,,,,,,
louder!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara moans louder and more weirdly.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia stirs, sits up, but doesn't open her eyes.,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara are excited then... disappointed as,,,,,,
Delia fumbles on the bedside table for the remote con-,,,,,,
trol device, and without opening her eyes, turns off,,,,
the television set.  Then she turns over, and is lost,,,,,
to the world totally.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara sighs.  She and Adam walk toward the door.,,,,,,
When they open it however, Lydia is standing there in,,,,,
her pajamas -- she snaps a FLASH Polaroid -- and Adam,,,,,,
and Barbara jump backwards with yelps of fright.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Sick!  Sexual perversion!  If,,,,,,
you're going to do weird sexual,,,,,,
stuff you ought to stay in your,,,,,,
bedroom, okay?,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia starts back into her room.  Then looks at the,,,,,,
developing photograph.  Something catches her eye.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia yelps with fear.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Holy cow!  No feet!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She screams.  Adam and Barbara scream.  Lydia rushes,,,,,,
back toward them, starts flashing pictures.,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara run around and are pushed into a,,,,,,
corner.  Polaroids fly everywhere.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia runs out of film.  She stares at them, panting,,,,,
with fear.  A standoff.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
A... Are you the guys who're,,,,,,
hiding out in the attic?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(fake terror voice),,,,,,
We're ghosts.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara moans.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(skeptical, cautious),,,,,
W... What do you look like under,,,,,,
there?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara pull shut bedroom door, go out into,,,,,
the hall -- as if to keep from waking Delia with their,,,,,,
conversation.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
All three stare at each other tentatively.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Aren't you scared?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren.,,,,,,
Those are sheets.  Are you gross,,,,,,
"under there?  Are you """"Night of",,,,,,
"the Living Dead"""" under there?",,,,,,
Like all bloody veins and pus?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
What?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
"Night of the Living Dead?""""  It's",,,,,,
a movie.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(pulling off,,,,,,
the sheet),,,,,,
If I had seen a ghost at your age,,,,,,
I would have been frightened out,,,,,,
of my wits.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
You're not gross.  Why were you,,,,,,
wearing a sheet?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
We're practicing.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
You can actually see us?  Without,,,,,,
the sheets?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Is this like a trick question?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Tell the truth.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(offended),,,,,,
Of course I can see you.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Nobody else can.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I'm wearing contacts... Also I,,,,,,
"read through the """"Handbook for the",,,,,,
"Recently Deceased.""""  It says that",,,,,,
live people ignore the strange and,,,,,,
unusual... I, myself, am strange,,,,
and unusual.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(tenderly),,,,,,
You look like a regular girl to me.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia blushes.  Barbara smiles warmly.  She is begin-,,,,,,
ning to like Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
You read our book?  Could you,,,,,,
follow it?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia nods her head.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Why are you creeping around,,,,,,
Delia's bedroom?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
We were trying to scare your,,,,,,
mother.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Stepmother.  I'm very sensitive,,,,,,
about being related to reptiles.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara smiles.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
You can't scare her.  She's,,,,,,
sleeping with Prince Valium,,,,,,
tonight.,,,,,,
(defiantly),,,,,,
I stole the key to your attic, you,,,,,
know.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara look at each other.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Maybe we better talk.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam's rigged up the moon, and stars, too.  Adam and,,,,
Barbara and Lydia stand just beyond the fringes of the,,,,,,
town, dimly lighted giants.,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
You did this?  You carved all,,,,,,
these little figures and houses,,,,,,
and things?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(pleased),,,,,,
I certainly did.  I'd finish it,,,,,,
too, but... I don't get out much.,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
And this used to be your house, I,,,,,
bet.  Why do you want to scare,,,,,,
everybody?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
We want to frighten you away.,,,,,,
(a little embarrassed),,,,,,
So that you'll move out.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
You don't know the Deetz's very,,,,,,
well, do you?  My father bought,,,,,
this place.  He never walks away,,,,,,
from equity.  Why don't you leave?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
We can't.  We haven't left the,,,,,,
house since the funeral.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Funeral.  God, you guys really are,,,,,
dead!,,,,,,
(fascinated),,,,,,
What was it like?  The funeral.,,,,,,
Did you cry?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
We weren't there.  The handbook,,,,,,
says funerals aren't for the dead.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
God, if this is true this is,,,,,
amazing!  I kinda like it up,,,,,,
here.  Can I visit you sometimes?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Well, I don't know... We don't get,,,,,
many visitors.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
You know you're really a pretty,,,,,,
girl.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia flushes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES (O.S.),,,,,,
Lydia!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I better go...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Wait... I don't think it would be,,,,,,
a very good idea if you told your,,,,,,
parents that we're up here.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Unless you think it would scare,,,,,,
them off.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia starts to exit.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
You tell them that we are,,,,,,
desperate horrible ghoulish,,,,,,
creatures who will stop at nothing,,,,,,
to get back our house.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(looks him up,,,,,,
and down),,,,,,
Wait a minute, what if this is a,,,,,
dream?  Can you do any tricks to,,,,,,
prove I'm not dreaming?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara shakes her head, a little ashamed.,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Well, if you are real ghosts, you,,,,
better get another routine, those,,,,,
sheets suck!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She sneaks a smile at Barbara and exits.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT. HOUSE - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A big ugly machine is doing something unnecessary to,,,,,,
the yard.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DARKROOM/BASEMENT - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The FAST-TICKING CLOCK is a timer.  Lydia is making,,,,,,
Polaroid enlargements.  She's quick and expert at this.,,,,,,
She's examining a print with a magnifying glass.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia shrieks.  Going through the dirty clothes, she's,,,,,
just come across the sheets with the eye holes in them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Lydia!  Lydia!  My hands are,,,,,,
shredded from doing the laundry,,,,,,
and now I have to deal with your,,,,,,
vandalism!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia, pounding up from the basement with the wet,,,,,
print, collides with Delia, rushing down from the sec-,,,,
ond floor with the scissored sheets.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Lydia, honest to God I'm going to,,,,,
kill you.  I'm having a party,,,,,,
tonight.  I'm cooking, I can't get,,,,,
servants.  Do I need angst?  No, I,,,,,
certainly do not!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia speeds by her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
You owe me three-hundred bucks,,,,,,
Lydia!  Don't go running to your,,,,,,
father, you worm.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia rushes in.  Charles is working furiously on a,,,,,,
word processor, amidst an array of maps and plans.,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Dad.  Do you believe me?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Yes.  Except when you creep around,,,,,,
in your mother's --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Stepmother's...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
... sheets.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Well this is... I mean, this is,,,,,
the weirdest --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Lydia, I don't know what it is,,,,,
with you and these pratical,,,,,,
jokes, but --,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
This is not a joke!  That sheet,,,,,,
was full of ghosts.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She hands him the photo.  He looks.  Lydia points,,,,,,
out...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
No feet.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles laughs.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
You don't believe me.  That sheet,,,,,,
was full of ghosts.  They live,,,,,,
here.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles begins to scroll through computer program.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(dismissing it),,,,,,
Very clever, Lydia.  Now would you,,,,,
please -- I'll tell you what... I,,,,,,
know!  You're bored, right?  You,,,,,
take that camera and your bike,,,,,,
and photograph every building in,,,,,,
town.  Don't tell anyone what it's,,,,,,
for...,,,,,,
(handing her a,,,,,,
wad of bills),,,,,,
Here, take some cash and go do,,,,,
it.  How's that?  You want to,,,,,,
stretch, don't you?,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia exits, with determination.  Charles looks up on,,,,,
the wall and runs his finger over a plat map of Winter,,,,,,
River, just like Adam's in the attic.,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Look at the size of these lots...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam peers at the map, puzzled.,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
What is this guy doing?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara follows Lydia out.  Adam thinks, intrigued.,,,,,
Exits.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. KITCHEN - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia is frantically preparing for the evening's dinner,,,,,,
party.  Lydia is very much in her way, trying to show,,,,,
her the photographs.  Delia isn't looking at them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
I can't believe you are doing this,,,,,,
to me!  Ghosts.  I am giving a,,,,,,
dinner party for seven people,,,,,,
tonight.  Otho has agreed to come,,,,,,
back for the demolition of the,,,,,,
attic.  My agent, Bernard, is,,,,
bringing some woman who writes for,,,,,,
"Art in America.""""  In fact", no one,,,,,
here tonight has not been in,,,,,,
"Vanity Fair.""""  Except you.",,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(resigned),,,,,,
I told them you were too mean to,,,,,,
be afraid.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Don't you dare talk to others,,,,,,
about me.  I'm an artist!  The,,,,,,
only thing that scares me is being,,,,,,
embarrassed in front of my,,,,,,
friends.  Do you know how hard it,,,,,,
is to get civilized people to set,,,,,,
foot in this part of Connecticut?,,,,,,
Not a solitary word of this,,,,,,
pubescent tripe to anyone.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia exits angrily.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CAMERA HINGES.  Barbara is watching, horrified at,,,,,
Delia's occupation of her (Barbara's) kitchen.  Adam,,,,,,
appears.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Lydia's trying, but they don't,,,,,
believe her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
She's got photos, Barbara.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Adam, you had a photo of Big Foot!,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
This is different.  Eventually,,,,,,
she'll take someone to the attic.,,,,,,
And then what?  We've got to try,,,,,,
to contact this guy Betelmyer.  We,,,,,,
gotta get some help, hon.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC ROOM - LATER - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam looks intently through the book.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara's eye is caught by something in the model,,,,,,
cemetery.  She moves over and sees a small gravestone,,,,,,
lit up by neon.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Adam!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam comes over.  Looks.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
I didn't do that one... Hmmm.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
It's him.  Look... Betelgeuse...,,,,,,
Betelgeuse...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She looks at Adam," """"should I?"""" Adam chews his lip",,,,,
thoughtfully.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Go ahead... third time's a charm.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(after a deep breath),,,,,,
Betelgeuse!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ZAP!  They are transported into the model graveyard.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
WIND BLOWS --  With shovels and lanterns, Adam and,,,,,
Barbara are unlikely gravediggers.  The mechanized,,,,,,
clouds move in the sky across the mechanical moon,,,,,,
throwing weird shadows everywhere.  Ground fog creeps,,,,,,
slowly along the graves.  It is so eerie.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
What happened?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Three times.  Powerful number.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(standing in front,,,,,,
of grave),,,,,,
Bet... el... geuse.  What an,,,,,,
awful name.  I thought it was like,,,,,,
#NAME?,,,,,,
beetles.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam cringes too.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Where is he?  What do we do?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam looks down at the grave.  Knocks on the stone.,,,,,,
Nothing.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Has anything been simple so far?,,,,,,
From the look of the shovel, we,,,,,
dig.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Oh, Adam.  I don't have gloves.,,,,,
My nails keep getting longer.,,,,,,
I'll break them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Hands her a shovel anyway.  She digs.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT. INSIDE THE MODEL GRAVEYARD - LATER - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They're almost down six feet.  By now they are both,,,,,,
almost out of sight in the grave.  Inside the grave --,,,,,,
Adam suddenly hits wood.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
It's about time.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They lean down and brush dirt off a brass plate on the,,,,,,
coffin.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"BETELGEUSE""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
I guess we open it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Maybe we should knock first?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A slight TREMOR shakes them.  They look at each other,,,,,,
and try to scramble from the grave.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
TOPSIDE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They just barely crawl out when a mouldering corpse,,,,,,
springs out of the grave and jumps on Barbara's back,,,,,,
and plants a thousand-year-old kiss on her lips.  She,,,,,,
screams and burbles.  Adam pulls the corpse off her,,,,,,
back.  The corpse does a Three Stooges hammer on Adam's,,,,,,
head.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam staggers backward, unhurt but shocked.  All three,,,,,
stop.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON THE CORPSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Something unreal about him, almost mechanical.  Then,,,,,
the corpse, grinning insanely at them, flies straight,,,,
up into the air over their heads.  He CRASHES against,,,,,,
the tombstone...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
And Adam and Barbara see the corpse is only a huge,,,,,,
marionette on a string and pole.  A LAUGH comes from,,,,,,
behind the gravestone.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
PUPPETEER BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
steps out.  He looks like someone who just crawled out,,,,,,
from under a rock.  This is one slippery customer.,,,,,,
Betelgeuse speaks in a rapid polyglot, choosing words,,,,,
and phrases from every slang in the world.  Barbara is,,,,,,
mighty uneasy.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
All right.  Who are you?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
We're...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
You're the dead.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Aren't you dead?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Hell no!  I'm rolling.  I'm a,,,,,,
businessman.  I'm the man what,,,,,,
am.  Beeetel Jooose!  Who,,,,,,
do I gotta kill?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
You don't kill anyone.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Just get some people out of our,,,,,,
house.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Bio busting.  I love it.  Who do,,,,,,
I gotta kill?  Family -- right?,,,,,,
Obnoxious, I bet.,,,,,
(contorting face),,,,,,
Mommie, daddy, piglets.,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Just one daughter.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Hey you've been on Saturn!,,,,,,
(brushing yellow dust,,,,,,
off her),,,,,,
I hate those Sandworms!  Yecchhh!,,,,,,
I've lost a lot of buddies to,,,,,,
Sandworms.,,,,,,
(back to work),,,,,,
So a daughter?  She got good legs?,,,,,,
God I love a young leg.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Air blows up Barbara's dress, exposing her legs.  He,,,,,
leers.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
She's only fourteen...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
... acts like she's thirty-five.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(rubbing hands),,,,,,
How does she feel about short old,,,,,,
men with dirty ears?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara is grossed out and increasingly uneasy.  Beetle,,,,,,
Juice senses it and gets back to business.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
So you, the dead, want me, the,,,
undead, to throw the live guys --,,,,,
Mommie, Daddy and Lolita, who,,,,
might not mind a tumble with an,,,,,,
older guy, out into the cold?,,,,,
Even though they have paid hard,,,,,,
casharoonie for your dump?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
But... the Deetzes are destroying,,,,,,
our house.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(scolding sarcasm),,,,,,
You Maitlands are the backbone of,,,,,,
the afterlife.  So what's my cut?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Can you scare them off?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Beetle Juice looks offended.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Me, scary?  You be the judge.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He swirls his face and shoulders into a horrifying,,,,,,
image.  Pleased, he laughs at himself.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(decisively),,,,,,
Honey.  Let's go.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Go?  What d'ya mean?  We need,,,,,,
help.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
No, we don't.  We can work,,,,,
something out ourselves.  We just,,,,,,
have to try harder.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Hold on.  Let's not be squeamish,,,,,,
missy.  You rang my bell, you,,,,,
gotta lick the pump.  I'm rolling!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
grabs Adam.  Betelgeuse is getting mad.  Not pretty.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Folks, be reasonable here.  I'm at,,,,,
your service.  You be the judge.,,,,,,
I'm a harmless guy.  Try me.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Home.  Home.  Home!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ZAP,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They are gone.  Betelgeuse is furious.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
You fresh corpse creeps!  Who do,,,,,,
you think you are?... Walking,,,,,,
away from a professional?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
walks to a tree and kicks it hard.  The whole huge tree,,,,,,
falls, KABLOOM!,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A small tree falls in the model.  Adam, across the,,,,,
room, walks over and straightens it.,,,,,
,,,,,,
He looks at Barbara who is poring over the handbook.,,,,,,
Making notes.  Counting out procedures.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Honey, I think that was a mistake.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
I am not going to expose that,,,,,,
little girl to that... pervert,,,,,,
down there.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
How'd you do that?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(proud of herself),,,,,,
Just a hunch... remember things,,,,,,
come in threes -- three times in,,,,,,
three times out... I'm getting the,,,,,,
hang of this stuff.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
I think we really pissed him off.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
I don't care...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
But we let him out.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
I've changed my mind... I feel,,,,,,
really confident.  We're getting,,,,,,
better at this stuff.  We can,,,,,,
scare them off ourselves --,,,,,,
tonight!  I've got an idea.,,,,,,
You're going to love it... I'm,,,,,,
going to hate it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
turns to look down at the model again.  Straightens the,,,,,,
tree.  Turns away.  We can see a tiny light moving,,,,,,
through the tiny model forest towards the house.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM (V.O.),,,,,,
Okay.  But that Betelgeuse sure,,,,,,
seemed mad.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE (V.O.),,,,,,
(singing),,,,,,
Hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work I,,,,
go!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Dinner for seven, as promised.  Everything looks very,,,,,
nice.  Deetzes are in control and in their element.,,,,,,
The element is neurotic-chic.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Some of the guests are affecting distaste for having,,,,,,
had to make the long drive to Connecticut.  There's a,,,,,,
bitchy feud going on between GRACE," the """"Art In Amer-",,,,,
"ica"""" writer", and BERNARD, Delia's agent, that threatens,,,
to become a full-scale war.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Otho is drunkish and engaged in his third favorite,,,,,,
occupation -- direct attacks on the personal weaknesses,,,,,,
of his friends.  He's singled out his victim, BERYL,,,,,
the editor for Ballantine, a frail-looking woman who is,,,,,
"dressed """"artistically.""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
(to Beryl),,,,,,
Well, darling, you can only have a,,,,
hysterectomy once, so why don't you,,,,,
tell us what you really went into,,,,,,
the hospital for last week?  Or dare,,,,,,
I ask," is that a nose """"nouveau?""""",,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(privately; to,,,,,,
Otho),,,,,,
Otho, you've got to help me get,,,,,
Maxie Dean up here.  I have a deal,,,,,,
that could make all of us very,,,,,,
comfortable.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
He's a cloven-hooved beast!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
He's your cousin.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
I am ashamed to say he is.  Look,,,,,,
nothing short of giving away free,,,,,,
sacks of money would get him up,,,,,,
here, Charles.  And Sarah?  Forget,,,,,
it.  You can't get her out of,,,,,,
Bergdorf's with plastic explosives.,,,,,,
(still on Beryl's,,,,,,
case),,,,,,
I just hope it wasn't yet another of,,,,,,
your dreary suicide attempts.  You,,,,,,
know what they say about people who,,,,,,
who commit suicide.  In the afterlife,,,,,,
they become civil servants.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BERNARD,,,,,,
Otho!  I didn't know you were into,,,,,,
the supernatural?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
Of course you remember!  After my,,,,,,
stint with the living theatre.  I,,,,,,
was one of New York City's leading,,,,,,
paranormal researchers until the,,,,,,
bottom dropped out of the business,,,,,,
in '72.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BERYL,,,,,,
(sick to death of,,,,,,
this blowhard),,,,,,
Paranormal... Is that what they're,,,,,,
calling your kind now?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia watches Otho thoughtfully.  Suddenly very cur-,,,,,,
ious.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia senses that Lydia might talk ghosts here.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(a threat; quietly,,,,,,
to Lydia),,,,,,
Don't you dare.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I saw some ghosts.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
All quiet.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(interrupting),,,,,,
Lydia tried to play a most,,,,,,
amusing joke on me this afternoon.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
It wasn't a joke.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Tried to convince me that this,,,,,,
house is haunted.  Kids.  Kids.,,,,,,
Kids!  I love them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Otho's glance sharpens at this.  Everyone else listens.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
GRACE,,,,,,
By ghosts?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
By what else?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(laughing it away),,,,,,
In sheets yet.  Designer sheets.,,,,,,
They --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles, seeing things aren't going well for Delia,,,,,
proposes a toast.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
I propose a toast to our intrepid,,,,,,
friends.  Who braved the,,,,,,
expressway and fourteen toll,,,,,,
booths to visit us.  May your,,,,,,
buildings go condo.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
All lift their wineglasses.  All drink.  All synchro-,,,,,,
nously spit out their wine.  All together now...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EVERYONE,,,,,,
Yechhh!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles lifts the wine bottle from the cooler.  Disgust,,,,,,
spans the room.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON bottle -- it bears the familiar spread wings of,,,,,,
Thunderbird!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BERYL,,,,,,
Thunderbird wine?  My God, Delia,,,,,
don't you even have a Safeway up,,,,,,
here?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(horrified; but,,,,,,
recovering),,,,,,
Joke Joke!  Charles get the good,,,,,,
wine and I'll serve the shrimp.,,,,,,
It's a joke.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia stares a spike through Lydia.  Delia and Charles,,,,,,
rush into the kitchen.  Otho looks at his glass and,,,,,,
peers at Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia rushes to get the sushi.  Charles finds some,,,,,,
good wine.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(rapidly; furious),,,,,,
Lydia switched wines.  Charles --,,,,,,
if you do not agree right now, to,,,,,
boarding school, you can forget,,,,,
having what you call sex -- ever,,,,,,
again in your natural lifetime.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He nods reluctantly.  She rushes back to guests.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia is looking around curiously.  Delia and Charles,,,,,,
rush back in with sushi and good wine.  Delia pours for,,,,,,
Bernard, the obvious connoisseur.  He tastes the wine.,,,,,
All wait.  Is it Kerosene du Pape?  He smiles.  All,,,,,,
smile.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Otho is more interested in Lydia's story.  He leans,,,,,,
toward her...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
Now, Lydia... Favor us about your,,,,,
ghosts.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
No!  Do not encourage this,,,,,,
little... person.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
Oh, Delia, lighten up!,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
She's been without therapy up here,,,,,,
and I will not allow her to,,,,,,
ruin...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
But then:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Something comes over her -- she straightens, then,,,,,
crouches a little, her hand sweeps across in front of,,,,,
her, almost mechanically.  And then our Delia Deetz,,,,,
unable to help herself, leaves the whitebread world,,,,,
behind and possessed, sings in someone else's voice, a,,,,
rich, NEGRO TENOR.,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
If I didn't care, More than,,,,,
"words could say.""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia's eyes widen.  MUSIC UP.  All the guests are,,,,,,
spellbound.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles, too, has the beat -- The Ink Spots in his eyes.,,,,
In a voice not his own.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
If my every prayer, did not,,,,,
begin and end with just your,,,,,,
"name.""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia is shocked.  She looks at Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
For God's sake, stop me...,,,,,
,,,,,,
She is cut short by her powerful inspiration.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
I could not be true to you,,,,,,
"beyond compare.""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ALL THE GUESTS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
except Lydia, are possessed to become the chorus.  They,,,,,
stand by their chairs, they spin in perfect Motown,,,,,
choreography.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EVERYONE,,,,,,
(except Lydia),,,,,,
"Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
"If I didn't care... for you...""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
EVERYONE,,,,,,
"Shoo doo wop.  Shoo doo wop.""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
A look of sheer delight comes across Lydia's face,,,,,,
unlike anything we have previously seen.  She dances,,,,,,
and claps her hands in time with the music.  She is in,,,,,,
teen heaven.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
NOTE:  Delia and the guests are fully aware of their,,,,,,
singing/actions, but helpless to stop themselves.  While,,,,,
it is funny, it is nevertheless just a little frighten-,,,,,
ing.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia excitedly looks around the room to see if she can,,,,,,
see the ghosts.  She can't.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Now the song pauses... Everyone tries to recover for a,,,,,,
shocked second.  Instead, the tempo changes.,,,,,
,,,,,,
As the tempo quickens, the guest/chorus is syncopated,,,,,
like alternating pistons as they are pushed and pulled,,,,,,
into their chairs.  They sing throughout.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THE SONG,,,,,,
,,,,,,
crashes to its end.  Bernard looks down at his shrimp,,,,,,
cocktail.  The shrimp draped over the rice roll,,,,,,
suddenly rears up like a hand and, making a tiny fist,,,,,
grabs his dangling tie and... smash --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
WIDER -- All the guests are punched by the shrimp, back,,,,,
over their chairs to the ground.  They are stunned.,,,,,,
Suddenly everyone runs frightened into the next room.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT./INT. ATTIC ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara with huge smiles on their faces, dance,,,,,
the bugaloo then hug and kiss on the landing in front,,,,,,
of the attic.  Door is open.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
TOGETHER,,,,,,
We did it!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Let's watch 'em scatter.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They enter the attic and run to the window.  Look out,,,,,,
over the front yard.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
YARD OF HOUSE - THEIR POV - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
filled with the cars of the guests, as well as Delia,,,,,
and Charles' vehicles.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM (O.S.),,,,,,
Any minute now.  They'll all run,,,,,,
screaming.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BACK TO SCENE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They wait.  Nothing moving outside.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Your Ink Spots were wonderful!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam smiles proudly.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
And your shrimp was remarkable.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
My shrimp?  I did the wine.,,,,,,
Didn't you do the sushi?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
N... No, I just did the Ink Spots.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA (V.O.),,,,,,
Who did the?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Timid KNOCK at the door of the attic.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara glances at Adam.  They don't know what to do.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(from outside the,,,,,,
door),,,,,,
It's me.  Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam, puzzled, goes to the door and opens it.  Lydia is,,,,
standing there, sheepish.,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
They'd like for you to come,,,,,,
downstairs.  Delia says you can,,,,,,
pick any sheets you want.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The guests are sitting expectantly.  The photographs,,,,,,
are being passed around.  The wheels are turning in,,,,,,
Charles' mind --  he sees a gold mine.  Everyone speaks,,,,,,
at once.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
It does indicate a marvelously,,,,,,
urbane sense of humor on the part,,,,,,
of these ghosts -- that they,,,,,,
actually appear in sheets!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
We're dealing with Tracy and Hepburn,,,,,,
here, a very sophisticated pair.  We,,,,,
must protect them, treat them with,,,,,
respect.  Nurture them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
People will pay big money for,,,,,,
this.  Right, Grace?,,,,,
,,,,,,
GRACE,,,,,,
(nodding),,,,,,
Charles, I want to know why you,,,,,
didn't tell me about this --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(now changing her,,,,,,
tune),,,,,,
We were waiting for proof.,,,,,,
Lydia's photographs...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles is scheming.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BERNARD,,,,,,
(skeptical),,,,,,
What are you all talking about?,,,,,,
We... we just got a little drunk,,,,,,
that's all.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
No matter how drunk you get, you,,,,,
cannot sound like the Ink Spots.,,,,,,
(to Charles),,,,,,
Charles, this is it!  You can get,,,,,
Maxie Dean up here now.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles plots and plans.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
His wife Sarah loves the,,,,,,
supernatural.  I did a reading for,,,,,,
her just last week.  Told her her,,,,,,
jowls would tighten soon.  I mean,,,,,,
she will make him sprint up here in,,,,,,
his helicopter if you can produce,,,,,,
ghosts for her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BERYL,,,,,,
"The """"Enquirer"""" has offered fifty",,,,,,
thousand dollars for absolute,,,,,,
proof of life after death.  I'll,,,,,,
send them over.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BERNARD,,,,,,
I'm Delia's agent!  I've lost,,,,,,
money for years on her work.  If,,,,,,
anything actually happened here,,,,,,
I'll handle it, thank you.  But,,,,,
not until I see some real proof.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia appears at the base of the stairs.  Everyone,,,,,,
stops squabbling, looks at her expectantly.,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
They don't want to come down.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
Why not?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Bernard shakes his head as if all this were an elaborate,,,,,,
hoax.  He harumphs!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I think the reason is they were,,,,,,
trying to scare you, and you,,,,,
didn't get scared --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Of course we weren't scared.,,,,,,
(looking around),,,,,,
Just a little startled.  One of,,,,,,
those shrimp dropped down my,,,,,,
Kamali.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Bernard is now convinced this whole business was a put-,,,,,,
on.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BERNARD,,,,,,
(shaking his head),,,,,,
Total collective hallucination.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BERYL,,,,,,
I was a little tipsie.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
This was not a hallucination,,,,,,
people.  This was real, really,,,,,
totally real.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
GRACE,,,,,,
Of course, they were rather,,,,,
spectacular effects -- for,,,,,,
Connecticut, I mean.,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
All presences have a home space.  A,,,,,,
place where they live, so to speak.,,,,,
Where do they hide out?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(reluctantly),,,,,,
The attic.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
The attic room is locked --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
They're ghosts.  They do what they,,,,,,
want.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
"Fabulous!  Otho Fenlock's """"Locked",,,,,,
"Door"""" ghosts!  Probably committed",,,,,,
suicide up there -- hanging like,,,,,,
beeves from the rafters.  I'm,,,,,,
totally enchanted.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Bernard gathers Grace and Beryl and walks out the door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BERNARD,,,,,,
Delia, you are a flake.  You have,,,,,
always been a flake.  I'm packing,,,,,,
up and going back to the tricks of,,,,,,
the city.  That I can manage.  If,,,,,,
you must frighten people, do it,,,,,
with your sculpture.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They exit.  Delia is horrified and embarrassed.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Wait!  I'm going to get to the,,,,,,
bottom of this!  Lydia, is this,,,,,
some high-tech trick of yours?  I,,,,,,
want you to take us up there tout,,,,,,
sweet!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. LANDING OUTSIDE OF ATTIC,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia, Charles, Otho and Lydia -- creep, creep.,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(whispering),,,,,,
Shhh.  They're in there?  God,,,,,,
they live like animals.  This is,,,,,,
where they've been hiding out?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia nods.  Delia suddenly, brashly pounds on the,,,,,
door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(shouting),,,,,,
All right, you dead people!  Come,,,,,
on out, or we'll break down this,,,,,
door and drag you out on the ropes,,,,,,
you hanged yourself with!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Shhhh.  They didn't commit,,,,,,
suicide.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
It doesn't matter.,,,,,,
What matters is I've got a roomful,,,,,,
of guests down there, who think,,,,,
I'm a fraud.,,,,,,
(to Lydia),,,,,,
I am going to teach you something,,,,,,
here Lydia.  You've got to take,,,,,,
the right tone in things like,,,,,,
this, or people -- whether they're,,,,,
dead or alive -- people will walk,,,,,,
all over you.,,,,,,
(loud),,,,,,
Come on out, or I will make death,,,,,
so miserable that you will wish,,,,,,
you had never lived!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia pounds on door, which opens with an eerie CREAK.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia is pushed in first.  She looks around.  Delia,,,,,,
Charles and Otho come in next, carefully.  One by one,,,,,
they straighten up and look around.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(whisper),,,,,,
So where are they, Lydia?,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia shrugs, looks around.,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(off-handedly),,,,,,
Answer your mother.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Listen, you guys.  These ghosts,,,,,
are really nice people.  I think,,,,,,
we scared them off.  Let's just,,,,,,
leave them alone.  Okay?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles is suddenly transfixed.  He stares at the,,,,,,
model.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
It's the whole damn town.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They gather around.  Lydia is a little sad as she looks,,,,,,
at the empty room and the model.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
Look at that detail!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Look at the tiny figures.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Look at all that parking!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
They're not here, Lydia?,,,,,
,,,,,,
She shakes her head.  Otho spots the handbook.  Palms,,,,,,
it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
I have never been so,,,,,,
embarrassed... They haven't gone,,,,,,
for good, have they?,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia is suddenly out the door, urging them all outside.,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Everyone out of there.  If they're,,,,,,
in there somewhere, I don't want,,,,,
to scare them away.  Come on now,,,,,,
stay out of there.  We've got work,,,,,,
to do.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Otho pockets the handbook secretly as everyone exits.,,,,,,
Delia carefully closes the door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CAMERA EASES OVER TO THE WINDOW,,,,,,
,,,,,,
We see two pairs of hands, white-knuckled, gripping the,,,,
window sill from the outside.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam are hanging outside the window.,,,,,,
CAMERA EASES BACK to see that instead of hanging from,,,,,,
the house --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They are hanging from a ledge over The Inferno --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON INFERNO,,,,,,
,,,,,,
circles of rosy hell.  Several devilish Monsters slaver,,,,,,
up at them, hoping for new meat for the furnace.  Small,,,,,
geysers spurt foul gasses.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
WINDS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BLOW hard on Adam and Barbara.  They struggle to hold,,,,,,
on and pull themselves back up and into the window.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Juno, help!  Juno!,,,,,
,,,,,,
After nearly falling, Adam barely saves Barbara and,,,,,
they finally make it up, and disappear into the window.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC LANDING - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia, Charles and Otho all start down the stairs, one,,,,
by one.  All are holding the handrail.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Lydia, I will never forgive you,,,,,
for embarrassing me in front of my,,,,,,
social inferiors.  You help us,,,,,,
with these ghosts or you'll be,,,,,,
sorry.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I'm sorry already.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(fixing on Otho),,,,,,
Now, let's get back to business.  I,,,,,
I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah,,,,,,
up here immediately.  I can make,,,,,,
history here!  I'm going to turn,,,,,,
this sleepy little backward town,,,,,,
into a leading supernatural,,,,,,
research center... and amusement,,,,,,
park.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(disgusted),,,,,,
I cannot believe this.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Delia will cook...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia glares at him.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
I'll bring the wine... and the,,,,,,
business plan.  And Lydia --,,,,,,
you'll bring the ghosts.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(frustrated),,,,,,
I can't bring the ghosts.  They're,,,,,,
not here!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
... Otho, could you actually... do,,,,,
something with them?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
(pats the handbook,,,,,,
under his coat),,,,,,
Perhaps... if I were properly,,,,,,
motivated...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
That's slavery and murder.  You,,,,,,
don't know them.  They're nice,,,,,,
people!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
POV -- down the handrail, as they walk downstairs.,,,,,
Lydia lags behind, sullen.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LOWER END OF THE HANDRAIL,,,,,,
,,,,,,
lifts, and turns.  The handrail has become a long, fat,,,,
diamond-backed snake -- unlike any we have ever seen.,,,,,,
It flashes terrifying steel teeth and a red-feathered,,,,,,
comb.  It turns and HISSES at them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON DELIA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She screams as she looks down at her hand on the rail,,,,,,
#NAME?, throbbing, dripping body of the,,,,
snake.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THE SNAKE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
just gets longer and nastier as it turns back in the,,,,,,
air, up the stairs toward them.  Its tail circles Delia,,,,,
and spins her like a top.  When she stops -- the snake,,,,,,
gives her a big wet snake kiss.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
SNAKE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
snaps Otho in the behind.  It hurts.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THE SNAKE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
rears up and spreads a red-comb and HISSES loudly.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ALL THREE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
of them fall over each other trying to escape.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THE SNAKE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
hovers horribly over them.  Grabs Charles in its coils,,,,,,
and squeezes him hard -- his fearful face reddens, then,,,,,
it suspends Charles over the edge of the stairs.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
SNAKE,,,,,,
We've come for your daughter,,,,,,
Chuck!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
HE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
leers at Lydia and drops Charles like a rock over the,,,,,,
bannister.  Charles screams.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THE SNAKE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Grins at a terrified Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
SNAKE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
rears back for a strike, when suddenly, like thunder.,,,,
One word is heard.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Betelgeuse!  Betelgeuse!,,,,,,
Betelgeuse!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THE SNAKE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
looks up with familiar eyes.  At top of stairs stands,,,,,,
an angry Barbara.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
What happens next is almost too fast for the eye to,,,,,,
see.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
THE SNAKE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
shrinks and turns back into the regular mahogany hand-,,,,,,
rail.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
or his outline, whips up the stairs, through the door,,,,
and is gone like a rocket.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
RRRatt shit!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO AND DELIA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
rush downstairs -- Lydia is terrified.  She runs away.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I hate you!  I thought you were my,,,,,,
friends.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
No, wait!,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia screams and runs down the stairs.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(screams),,,,,,
I hate all of you!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Slowly, Barbara returns to the attic.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara are exhausted.  Agitated.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Great choice we've got here.  We,,,,,,
get to spend the next century,,,,,,
either hanging out that window or,,,,,,
doing parlor tricks.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam is working with the model town.  Barbara is pac-,,,,,,
ing.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Maybe they'll leave now.  That,,,,,,
snake was a pretty nasty customer.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
He might have hurt somebody.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
But he didn't.  We've got him,,,,,,
where we want him.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON THE MODEL,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A column of water shoots high in the air.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam rushes over to the model -- looks down.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. MODEL - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse has run a beat-up old pickup into a fire,,,,,,
hydrant.  He stands nearby, hopping mad; shakes his,,,,,
fist at Adam.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
You pansy-assed cretins!  How dare,,,,,,
you do that to me.  I coulda,,,,,,
finished the job!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
IN THE ATTIC,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam, obviously disturbed, look at one,,,,
another with concern.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE (V.O.),,,,,,
(thin and pip-,,,,,,
ing voice),,,,,,
Why did you stop me?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
I don't like Charles Deetz,,,,,,
particularly, but you could have,,,,,
killed him.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Hey, I've been bottled up for six,,,,,
hundred years.  Every dog has his,,,,,,
day.  This is my town.  I need a,,,,,,
night to howl.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
This is my town.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
You wish!  I nearly scored with,,,,,,
that little blonde.  I need me a,,,,,,
short little queen.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Angry, Barbara reaches down into the model and plucks,,,,,
Betelgeuse up.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara lifts him up toward her, squeezing him,,,,,
slightly.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
You leave her alone, you horrid,,,,,
little prick!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CLOSEUP - BETELGEUSE IN BARBARA'S HAND,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse grins.  Suddenly large spikes shoot out all,,,,,,
over his body, piercing the skin of Barbara's palm and,,,,,
fingers.  Barbara's blood is a rich pink.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She squeals and releases the evil spirit and he plum-,,,,,,
mets.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT. MODEL - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse lands on the town common.  Betelgeuse is,,,,,,
defiant.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Go ahead.  Make my millenium!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"We hear the tinny strains of """"Honky Tonk Angel"""" as if",,,,,,
from down the street.  He turns around to follow it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
This burg got a cathouse?  I'm,,,,,,
getting anxious if you know what I,,,,,,
mean.  Six hundred years and all.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He turns the corner to a whorehouse, with women --,,,,,
women with demon horns -- hanging out of the window,,,,,,
beckoning.  Betelgeuse rubs his hands together and,,,,,,
swaggers inside.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara aghast, watching this from above.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Adam!  Why did you build a whore,,,,,,
house?  Have you ever been to...?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
I didn't --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He doesn't finish -- a strong WIND blows through the,,,,,,
attic, nearly knocking Barbara and Adam over.  They,,,,,
close their eyes against the gale.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
When they open their eyes again, they're no longer in,,,,,
the attic.  They're in --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. JUNO'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A cubicle in a much larger office.  Miss Argentina,,,,,,
swishes by.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
RECEPTIONIST,,,,,,
God, you have got her steaming,,,,,
now.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She exits.  There are other special workers.  The place,,,,,,
is really, really busy.  Adam and Barbara sit down to,,,,,
wait.  Juno storms through with a sheaf of papers.  She,,,,,,
sees them.  She is steaming mad.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
The whorehouse was my idea.  I,,,,,,
want Betelgeuse out of the,,,,,,
picture!  We've got some serious,,,,,,
talking to do.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
About what?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
You people have really screwed,,,,,,
up!  I received word that you,,,,,,
allowed yourselves to be,,,,,,
photographed.  And you let,,,,,,
Betelgeuse out and didn't put him,,,,,,
back, and you let Otho get ahold,,,,,
of the handbook.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Handbook?  When...?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
(continuing tirade),,,,,,
Never trust the living!  We cannot,,,,,,
have a routine haunting like yours,,,,,,
provide incontrovertible visual,,,,,,
proof of existence beyond death.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Well, we didn't know --,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A BUNCH OF FOOTBALL PLAYERS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
follow Juno like hungry dogs.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DUMB #1,,,,,,
Hey, Coach, where's the men's,,,,
room?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
(frustrated),,,,,,
I'm not your coach.  He survived.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DUMB #2,,,,,,
You don't need a men's room.,,,,,,
You're not no man no more.  But,,,,,,
Coach, let me get this -- What's,,,,,
our curfew over here?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They start squabbling.  Juno has to wrangle them into,,,,,,
another room.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
(frustrated),,,,,,
I'll be right back.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. KITCHEN - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles sits at the table with a small bandage on his,,,,,,
head.  Delia takes off her Gucci belt and whips it on a,,,,,,
chair absent-mindedly.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
I feel like we've been at war,,,,,,
Charles.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
At least insofar as we have our,,,,,,
first casualty.  Me.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Otho'll know what to do.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
What's he going to do?  Viciously,,,,,,
rearrange their environment?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Otho knows just as much about the,,,,,,
supernatural as he knows about,,,,,,
interior design.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Let's hope he knows how to produce,,,,,,
those damn ghosts for Max and,,,,,,
Sarah... Because I've bought,,,,,,
options on property all over town.,,,,,,
I need Max's financing...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Just don't tell Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Why not?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
I think she's in with them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DISSOLVE TO:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. LYDIA'S BEDROOM - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
It's dark.  The bedroom curtains have been closed.,,,,,,
DRAMATIC OPERA MUSIC builds throughout.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia melodramatically dressed in a long black dress,,,,,,
appears carrying a candle.  She is softly crying.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She sits at her dressing table, the candlelight shows,,,,,
her writing paper.  She begins a very dramatic letter.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I am alone.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She looks at it and crumpling the paper, starts again.,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
I am utterly... alone.  You have,,,,,,
sealed my fate with your betrayal.,,,,,,
I can no longer stand to be used,,,,,,
like a puppet between two,,,,,,
deceitful worlds.  By the time you,,,,,,
read this, I will be gone, having,,,,
jumped off...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She scratches that out.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
... having plummeted off the,,,,,,
Winter River Bridge.  Then you,,,,,,
will know that I am no longer a,,,,,,
toy in your petty feuds.  Goodbye,,,,,,
Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A tear falls on the paper as she folds it and puts it,,,,,,
in an envelope.  OPERA MUSIC BUILDS AND CONTINUES.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. CHARLES' OFFICE - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia slowly makes a copy of the suicide note.  The,,,,,,
green of the Xerox light falls eerily on her sad face.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. HALLWAY - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia at bottom of attic stairs.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA'S POV - STAIRS AND DOOR AT TOP,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They look ominous.  She starts upward.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC ROOM - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The door opens and Lydia peers in.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The room is empty.  Lydia comes inside.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Are you here?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She hears SOMETHING.  Looks all around the room.,,,,,,
Nothing.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come,,,,,,
for the last time?,,,,,,
(laying note on,,,,,,
table),,,,,,
Where are you?  Barb...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE (V.O.),,,,,,
They're dead.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia looks around, then peers into model.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE (V.O.),,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Think small.  I'm talking to you.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT. MODEL TOWN - BUILDING ROOF - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A tiny Betelgeuse on the roof of a building, wearing a,,,,,
silk dressing gown, looking like he just dragged him-,,,,,
self out of bed.  One of the horned whores is nude,,,,,,
sunbathing in the corner, and Betelgeuse drapes a,,,,,
blanket over her.  Lydia's face looms enormous in the,,,,,,
sky.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Cookie, they are dead, dead,,,,
deadski.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Of course they're dead.  They're,,,,,,
ghosts.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
No, I mean they've gone.,,,,,
Decamped.  Split.  Vanished.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Where'd they go?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
The happy hunting ground.  Who,,,,,,
cares?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Are you a spirit too?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Sort of.  High spirit.  Heh heh.,,,,,,
Listen, cookie, I've been trapped,,,,
in this burg for hundreds of,,,,,,
years.  All I want is to get out.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I want to get in.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
You do?  Over here?  On my side?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I think so.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(scheming quickly),,,,,,
Well, yes, of course.  It's great,,,,
over here.  You'll meet all the,,,,,,
greats.  James Dean.  Sid,,,,,,
Vicious...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Well, it can't be any worse than,,,,,
my life here.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(sinister, encouraging,,,,,
her),,,,,,
That's right.  They treat you like,,,,,,
scum, I bet?,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Yeah.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
I can't help you from this side,,,,,,
but here's how we do it.  So,,,,,,
simple.  Say my name three,,,,,,
times.  That's all.  I'll be all,,,,,,
yours.  Then I'll bring you over,,,,,,
here in style.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I... I don't know what your name is.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Minor problem.  The rules.  I,,,,,,
can't tell it to you.  But.. do,,,,,,
you know how to play charades?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Yes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Of course you do.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He holds up two fingers in a V.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Two words.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse holds up one finger.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
First word.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse puts two fingers on his arm.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Three syllables.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
No, dummy.  Two.,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Your fingers are so small I can't,,,,,,
see them.  First word -- two,,,,,,
syllables.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He points behind her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
I don't know what that signal,,,,,,
means.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
It means look behind you, bimbo.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,

Lydia looks behind her.  A greet beetle the size of a,,,,,,
Volkswagen is crouching.  Its feathery antennae reach,,,,,,
out toward her menacingly.  Lydia yelps.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Beetle!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Good girrrl!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
POP!  The beetle disappears.  Betelgeuse holds up two,,,,,,
fingers.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(still shaken),,,,,,
Second word.  Be careful.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Apprehensive, she jumps when a simple carton of orange,,,,,
juice materializes.  Orange juice pours out into a,,,,,,
ghostly glass.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Breakfast?  Orange?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The orange juice disappears.  He shakes his head.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Breakfast beetle?  Beetle?  Beetle,,,,,,
fruit?  Fruit bat?  Fruit Battle?,,,,,,
Volkswagen?  Fruit wagon?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Good thing you are a beautiful,,,,,,
kid.  You are dumb!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"Betelgeuse does the signal for """"Now Put Them Together.""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I am not!  Beetle... Juice?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(jumping with delight),,,,,,
That's it!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Your name is Beetle Juice?  Yecch!,,,,,,
That's as bad as Deeelia Deeetz.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
It's spelled different, but,,,,,
basically... Now you said it,,,,,,
twice, just one more time.  And,,,,,
I'll be free.,,,,,,
(sinister),,,,,,
And then you'll be free.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia, puzzled, gets the magnifying glass and peers at,,,,
him.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON HIS UGLY FACE BIG IN THE GLASS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse jumps in the air, his robe parts -- we don't,,,,,
see anything, but maybe Lydia does.,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
God, you're anatomically correct!,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Just say it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(recognizing something,,,,,,
about him),,,,,,
You were the snake!  Right?  I,,,,,,
know.  It was you.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
You've got to say it!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
No I don't.  I don't take orders,,,,,,
from Smurfs.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
How'd you like to be married to...,,,,,,
the King...?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia doesn't get it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
... Elvis?...,,,,,,
(boasting),,,,,,
You know, ever since he came over,,,,,
he and I have been just like this.,,,,,,
(crosses his fingers),,,,,,
I can arrange it.  Just say my,,,,,,
name one more time.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She thinks about that one.  Shakes her head.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
No, No... I need to talk to,,,,,
Barbara.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse smiles.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Well, cookie, just say my name.  I,,,,
can get her.,,,,,,
(rubbing his horny little,,,,,,
hands together),,,,,,
That and so much more...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia walks around thinking for a moment.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Who else did you say is over,,,,,,
there?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. JUNO'S OFFICE - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Juno staring at them, hard.,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
Yes... or no?  Do you want the,,,,,,
Deetzes out or in?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Out.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
What about Betelgeuse?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
Forget him.  He'll remain with his,,,,,,
whores until someone calls him.,,,,,,
You need to worry about people like,,,,,,
Otho.  There are a lot of,,,,,,
phony trance mediums.  They,,,,,,
usually can't make the formulas,,,,,,
work, but if Otho stumbles on the,,,,,
right words in that handbook... he,,,,,,
could hurt you.  As in --,,,,,,
exorcism.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They both look puzzled.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
In plain English -- that's death,,,,,,
for the dead.  I don't care what,,,,,,
it takes, just get them out of,,,,,
there now.  It's not pretty, but,,,,,
-- that's death!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam stands to go.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Wait a minute.  Let's see what,,,,,,
you're going to do...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They look at Juno.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
... to scare her.  I want to make,,,,,,
sure it's not some silly parlor,,,,,,
trick.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara looks at Adam.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
I'll do the hard part, hon.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
reluctantly pulls on his face, and contorts it into a,,,,,
living, breathing, horror.  Juno is even a little,,,,
repulsed.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
Not bad.  Not bad.  Now you?  Go,,,,,,
ahead.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She reluctantly does with her face a minor version of,,,,,,
Adam's horror.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JUNO,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Okay.  You look great!  Now go,,,,,,
clean house.  And don't forget the,,,,,,
photographs and the damned,,,,,,
handbook.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam slowly stand and walk out the door.,,,,,,
Barbara/Monster looks back pleadingly.  Football,,,,,,
players flood into Juno's office.  One PARTICULARLY,,,,,,
DUMB PLAYER has a revelation.  (He's pretty grisly,,,,,,
maybe sat too close to the engine.),,,,,,
,,,,,,
PARTICULARLY DUMB PLAYER,,,,,,
Coach!  Coach, I don't think we,,,,,
survived the crash!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam look at each other and continue out the,,,,,,
door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OUTSIDE JUNO'S OFFICE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They enter a long dark hallway.  They suddenly find,,,,,,
themselves standing in front of Lydia's room.  Adam/,,,,,,
Monster looks at Barbara/Monster as he grabs the door-,,,,,,
knob.  She stops him.  Tears fall down her sad ghostly,,,,,,
face.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Adam.  I can't do it.  I like that,,,,,,
little girl.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM/MONSTER,,,,,,
It's too late.  Sometimes things,,,,,,
just work out this way.  We have,,,,,,
to, honey.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA/MONSTER,,,,,,
No we don't.  We can rebel or,,,,,,
something.  We'll just stay up,,,,,,
there in our room.  I'll read, you,,,,,
can build on the model.  Come on.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She rushes up the stairs, toward the attic.  He follows,,,,,
her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM/MONSTER,,,,,,
Wait.  We can't, honey.  Our,,,,,
house...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She gets to the door.  Grabs the handle.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
I want to be with Lydia!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She throws open the door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia is standing over the model, about to say,,,,,
Betelgeuse's name.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Okay.  Beetle... J...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara/Monster, horrified, screams!,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA/MONSTER,,,,,,
!  Lydia, stop!,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam/Monster runs to grab her.  Lydia is terrified.,,,,,,
Screams.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM/MONSTER,,,,,,
No, don't say it!,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Say it!  Rat shit!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse slips off the roof into a patch of thorny,,,,,,
bushes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia screams, Adam/Monster tries to calm her.  Lydia,,,,,
struggles and, thinking she is being attacked, runs out,,,,
the door.  Smack into Barbara/Monster.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara catches her, frightens Lydia even more.,,,,,
Barbara holds onto her as she struggles.  Barbara/,,,,,,
Monster slowly changes back into regular Barbara.,,,,,,
Lydia sees who it is and she hugs her.  Like mother and,,,,,,
daughter.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON ADAM - slowly returning to himself.  He smiles,,,,,,
slightly at the scene.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE (O.S.),,,,,,
You lily-livered bleeding hearts!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
I'm so sorry we frightened you.,,,,,,
What were you doing?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
He... Beetle Jui...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara quickly puts her hand over her mouth.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
He said if I let him out he would,,,,,,
take me over to the other side to,,,,,,
find you.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
No, Lydia, we're dead.,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
I want to be dead, too.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(shocked),,,,,,
No you don't!  No... Lydia... Why?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(after a pause,,,,,,
dramatically,,,,,,
but for real),,,,,,
Life is just... unliveable...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara hugs her.  She fumbles for words.  This is an,,,,,,
unusual situation, a dead person talking a live person,,,,,
out of killing herself.  She rocks Lydia a little.,,,,,,
Barbara looks at Adam.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Lydia, believe me... we know...,,,,,
all the hard stuff is the same,,,,,,
over here.  You're going to be who,,,,,,
you are... whether you're alive or,,,,,,
dead... and over here -- it's...,,,,,,
It's flat... there's no food, no,,,,,
colors... you can't smell the,,,,,,
flowers.,,,,,,
(thinking),,,,,,
If we knew then what we know,,,,,,
now... we'd have been more,,,,,,
careful...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(in the style of the,,,,,,
dead receptionist),,,,,,
... we wouldn't have had our,,,,,,
little accident.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia looks at Barbara lovingly.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
So never let Beetlejuice out --,,,,,,
never.  Besides...,,,,,,
(looking at Adam),,,,,,
We're thinking about letting,,,,,,
everyone stay... you and your,,,,,,
father and mother can stay too.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(smiles and says,,,,,,
slowly),,,,,,
Step... mother.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM/MONSTER,,,,,,
,,,,,,
is not sure, huffs around a little.  He is trying to,,,,,
change back into Adam, except for his nose, which,,,,
remains like a beak for a minute.  Finally, it changes,,,,,
too.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia and Barbara laugh at him.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Without noticing Lydia, Otho and Charles push in,,,,,
through the door and grab the model.  They take it out,,,,,,
the door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam is beside himself.  Doesn't know what to do.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara stops him from taking action.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
What is going on?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Really.  I don't know.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam looks suspiciously at her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
I really don't.  I'll go find out.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She runs out the door.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Be careful.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia runs through the hallway and into the dining,,,,,,
room.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia walks into a presentation in progress.  Sitting,,,,,,
around the table are Otho, Maxie, and Delia.  Sarah Dean,,,,
is there, too.  She looks around Lydia hoping for,,,,,
ghosts.  Sarah is heavily made up, smells bad.,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia's photos of the sheeted ghosts are blown up and,,,,,,
standing on a nearby easel.  Charles, over the model,,,,,
with a pointer, is lost in mid-sentence.,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
#NAME?, I've got options to,,,,,
buy enough of Main Street to,,,,,,
control the city council for a,,,,,,
hundred years.  And at the prices,,,,,,
I'm talking about, if it all fell,,,,,
apart tomorrow, we just move out and,,,,,
sell to the Arabs and we still come,,,,,,
out... I've talked to Ed Cornwall,,,,,,
about a wax museum, here... in,,,,,
Thanksgiving Park... Ed's the man,,,,,,
who made the talking Jesse Jackson,,,,,,
statue.,,,,,,
And I've got a museum dedicated to,,,,,,
50 Great Moments in the Paranormal,,,,,,
#NAME?, D-Con wants,,,,,
to the right to start an insect zoo,,,,,,
here in the old hardware store.,,,,,,
(seeing Lydia),,,,,,
Lydia, did you finally decide to,,,,,
join us?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They all give her an oily smile.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Honey, I am just finishing the first,,,,,
phase presentation about our little,,,,,,
project here.  Then we'll take a,,,,,,
stretch and invite our friends... to meet,,,,,,
your friends.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Sarah gets Maxie's attention and unable to contain her,,,,,,
excitement, silently urges him to get on with the,,,,,
ghosts.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
SARAH,,,,,,
Are they here yet?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
MAXIE,,,,,,
Yes, Charles, let's cut the,,,,
bullcorn.  We're here to see,,,,,,
ghosts.  This whole ghost town,,,,,,
museum and such like follows a,,,,,,
train, if you've got the engine...,,,,,
so let's see your goddamned engine.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Everyone looks at Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
They're... not here anymore.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(smiling apologetically),,,,,,
Nonsense, every time she says,,,,,
that, the paint peels, and some,,,,
wild creature tries to kill us.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
SARAH,,,,,,
(motioning),,,,,,
We've got these pictures, Lydia.,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
No, really... they said they might,,,,,
come back and all of us could live,,,,,,
in peace if you agreed not to,,,,,,
tease them or make them do silly,,,,,,
tricks.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Sarah is disappointed.  She goes to Maxie.  Delia takes,,,,,,
over.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
She's become a little emotional,,,,,,
about all this.  No counseling up,,,,,,
here.  But we aren't relying on,,,,,,
her.  No, we rely on,,,,,
professionals.  We have... Otho.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The whole room turns to Otho.  Who is scribbling some-,,,,,,
thing and mumbling.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Are they still here, Otho?,,,,,
,,,,,,
Otho looks up; he missed the question.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Are they still here, Otho?,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
Oh, they're still here.  They're,,,,,
just not showing up.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
They're probably guilty about what,,,,,,
they did to me.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
Not these people!  They are,,,,,,
ruthless!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
MAXIE,,,,,,
I don't care from guilt.  I just,,,,,,
want to see them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Otho, can you do it?,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
It's tricky, but I think I can,,,,,
handle it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He dramatically produces the handbook.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
No!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia begins to think about this scene and she shifts,,,,,,
to another point of view.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Wait a minute!  What am I worried,,,,,,
about?  Otho, you can't even,,,,,
change a tire!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
(taking the challenge),,,,,,
I'll need something personal of,,,,,,
theirs.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
You'll have to go to the Goodwill.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia gets an idea.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The moon stares down icily through gray clouds.  Wind,,,,,,
up.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara is looking out the window.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(wistful),,,,,,
You know, I've been thinking.  I,,,,,
could teach Lydia to sew.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Little black party dresses?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(punching him playfully),,,,,,
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything,,,,
about little girls.  She's just...,,,,,,
missed out on some love, that's,,,,,
all...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(huffy),,,,,,
Let's see if she can get my model,,,,,,
back.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
You can build another one... with,,,,,,
her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam isn't convinced.  Barbara motions him to sit next,,,,,,
to her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Come here, I want to talk to you.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Delia carefully brings out a big plastic bag.  Lays,,,,,,
something out on the dining room table.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
I'm deeply sentimental about...,,,,,,
weddings.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia stands to see:  Delia carefully lays out,,,,,,
Barbara's white wedding dress.  Then next to it, Adam's,,,,,
wedding tux.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia looks at it.  A chill runs through her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(hushed realization),,,,,,
Their wedding clothes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
(dramatically),,,,,,
Their wedding clothes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Otho then holds up the handbook.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
SARAH,,,,,,
"The """"words"""".",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Otho nods.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia is nervous now.  Otho lights a candle and Delia,,,,,,
turns out the lights.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
Hands vermillion / start of five,,,,,,
bright cotillion / raven's dive,,,,,,
nightshades promise / spirit's strive,,,,,,
to the living / let now the dead...,,,,,,
come alive.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Nothing happens.  Lydia nervously turns away.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(sarcastically),,,,,,
Doo wah.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Then a SIZZLE, a TINY CRACKLE, along one side of the,,,,
square.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara with her arm on his shoulder, talks to Adam.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
We've been given a gift here,,,,,,
honey.  A real live little girl.,,,,,,
She likes us a lot.  She needs,,,,,,
us.  Maybe that's why we died so,,,,,,
young, to keep us from getting,,,,,
so... attached to things.  The,,,,,,
house, antiques, your model.  Look,,,,
at us.  We didn't have room for,,,,,,
anyone.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(after a long thought),,,,,,
What makes you think she likes me?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara slowly smiles.  He does too.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He turns to Barbara.  CAMERA HINGES WITH him to see --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Her face is frightened.  She cannot speak.  She reaches,,,,,,
out to him -- but is disappearing.  He reaches for her,,,,,,
but she is suddenly -- GONE.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Varicolored lightning bolts shoot from every corner of,,,,,,
the square.  A gasp from everyone but Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON LYDIA -- she is looking away.  She turns to see:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON THE DRESS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara's wedding dress floats over the table and fills,,,,,,
slowly, painfully, with the arms, legs and finally the,,,
frightened face of Barbara.  A lightning bolt flares.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia rises slowly to her feet, unable to resist.,,,,,
,,,,,,
More lightning bolts.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
As sudden thunder / Pierces the night;,,,,,,
As magic wonder / Mad affright,,,,,,
Rives asunder / Man's delight:,,,,,,
Our ghost, our corpse and we,,,,,
Rise to be.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia walks slowly toward Barbara.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She is in pain, she is very slowly aging.  She speaks,,,,,
but no words can be heard.  Not even by Lydia.  But we,,,,,,
can see she is calling for... Adam.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Stop it!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
MAXIE,,,,,,
Shhhh!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia screams for Adam.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Adam.  Adam.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
(louder),,,,,,
As flies the lizard / Serpent fell;,,,,,,
As goblin vizard, / At the spell,,,,,
Of pale wizard, / Sinks to hell;,,,,,
The buried, dead, and slain...,,,,
Rise again.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. ATTIC - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
In a lightning flare we see: Adam searching for,,,,,,
Barbara.  He rushes out into the hallway.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Barbara!  Barbara?  Ba...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
His last plaintive call becomes mute as he too begins,,,,,,
slowly to disappear.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
On each of the watchers one by one, scared but,,,,,
delighted too.  No one is watching Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON LYDIA -- tears well up in her eyes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She is slowly aging.  Now a bewildered Adam appears,,,,,,
floating in his wedding suit.  Seeing his Barbara, now,,,,,
older than he is, Adam reaches for her hand...,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON HANDS -- as he grasps her hand, it seems to be made,,,,,
of white crepe; it wrinkles and nearly collapses.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam... puzzled, calls her name silently.,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
What's happening to them?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
I don't know.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Are they suffering?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(screams),,,,,,
They're dying.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
MAXIE,,,,,,
They're already dead.  They can't,,,,,,
feel a thing.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Obviously not true.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BARBARA -- she looks down slowly at Lydia and with,,,,,,
effort makes a loving smile.  She reaches out toward,,,,,,
Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Completely helpless now, Lydia weeps openly and then,,,,,
something comes over her.  She rushes across the room.,,,,,,
Stares down at the model.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Where are you?  Help us!  Please.,,,,,,
Betelgeuse!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A CRACK OF LIGHTNING.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
EXT. MODEL TOWN GRAVEYARD - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Someone, or something, like the figure of death in the,,,,
Goya drawing, is perched atop the gravestone of Barbara,,,,,
and Adam Maitland.  The graves beneath him are open.,,,,,,
The figure turns... it is Betelgeuse.  He is filing his,,,,,,
talons casually.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He speaks with a ghastly rasp.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
So... You're ready for me now?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
You've got to help them.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Can you help me?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(frightened),,,,,,
... I will.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Then I'll help them.  For a price.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He grins.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
W... What is it?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(his words echo,,,,,,
horribly,,,,,,
Be... my... queen!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(repulsed),,,,,,
Your qu...?  But you're...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(smiling devilishly),,,,,,
I'm beeyoo-teeful.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON LYDIA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She is chilled.  Steps back.,,,,,,
She turns back to the Maitlands who are continuing to,,,,,,
age.  Looks back to the model.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
... All right... Betelgeuse...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He doubles in size.  The tombstone crumbles beneath,,,,,,
him...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA (V.O.),,,,,,
(louder),,,,,,
Betelgeuse...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
WIDER ON GRAVEYARD,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He doubles in size again.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON LYDIA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She hesitates.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BETELGEUSE - TIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He looks up at her confidently.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
Betelgeuse!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DINING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara and Adam's corpses are nearly at the end of,,,,,,
their ropes.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
All right, that's enough.  Can you,,,,,
stop this now?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Otho doesn't answer.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Otho?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
It's too late, Charles.  I'm,,,,,
sorry.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia peers at the model.  Betelgeuse is transforming.,,,,,,
There's a LOW RUMBLE.  The model town starts to shake.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia backs away.  Betelgeuse's head, now human-size,,,,,
rises from the center of the model town.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
TIGHT ON HIS FACE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
His grin is malevolent and malicious.  It's showtime,,,,,,
folks!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Attention, K-Mart shoppers!,,,,,

ON DEETZES,,,,,,

,,,,,,
ON MODEL,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse begins a bright but sinister Carnival,,,,,,
Barker's pitch.  His shoulders now are clearing the,,,,,,
model.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Welcome to Winter River!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Sarah rushes over to the model, thinking this is more,,,,,
of the show.  Maxie follows.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Hel LO Piggies!  Welcome to Winter,,,,,,
River!  See the Museum of Natural,,,,,,
Greed.  The Monument to Bored,,,,,,
Businessmen!  Come closer!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Suddenly Betelgeuse's arms elongate, swell and CRACKLE.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON MAXIE AND SARAH,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Their eyes grow wide.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
TIGHT ON BETELGEUSE'S HANDS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
They split, unfurl, and transmutate into two, shiny,,,
huge sledgehammers.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He grins, his eyes sparkle in anticipation.  CARNEY,,,,,
MUSIC UP.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(roughly to the tune,,,,,,
"of """"Santa Claus is",,,,,,
"Coming to Town"""")",,,,,,
You better not sell, you better,,,,,
not buy...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON MAXIE AND SARAH,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Behind each of them, a graduated CARNIVAL BELL RINGING,,,,,
GAME STANDARD erects itself.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(still singing),,,,,,
Or old Uncle Beetle Claus will be,,,,,,
makin'... you... fly.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse swings his hammer/hands and sends Max and,,,,,,
Sarah zooming through the roof.  GONG.  GONG.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(in style of game,,,,,,
show host),,,,,,
Yowser, yowser.  Well, who do we,,,,
have here tonight?,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He looks up at the suspended Maitlands.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Let's have a hand for the,,,,,,
Maitlands, Barbara and Adam.  They,,,,,
deserve a rest.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON MAITLANDS,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Wispy shadows by now, but still alive/dead.  They fall,,,,,
in a heap on the floor.  NOTE:  They immediately start,,,,,,
to regenerate themselves.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Well, we'll get back to them after,,,,,
they recover from their flight.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON ADAM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Filling out again, he struggles to stand, but falls.,,,,
Barbara shakes her head, trying to regain her focus.,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(looking around),,,,,,
My God, what ugly wall dressing.,,,,,
Who is responsible for all this,,,,,,
ugliness?,,,,,,
(spying Otho trying,,,,,,
to hide),,,,,,
Otho, it's you!  Watch out for the,,,,,
taste patrol!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He waves and the door opens.  A little Italian gentle-,,,,,,
man appears.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
OTHO,,,,,,
No.  Noooo!  My God.  It's Giorgio,,,,,,
Armani!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
GIORGIO,,,,,,
Before youa getta started herea, I,,,,,

Youa too fat for human-type,,,,,,
clothes.  Ita makes my designs,,,,,,

,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Otho is horrified.  Suddenly he looks down and sees his,,,,,,
clothing has transformed into a polyester nightmare.,,,,,,
He runs out the door screaming.  Betelgeuese laughs,,,,,,
with delight then focuses on Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Let's leave this crazy world,,,,,,
behind us.  I'll take you out in,,,,,,
style!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Sound of eerie WEDDING MARCH.  The fireplace changes,,,,,,
into an expressionist altar.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
His leering horned whores walk like bridesmaids, in,,,,,
step, through the door.  They rush toward Lydia.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Frightened, Lydia is assaulted and pulled forward by,,,,,
these ugly handmaidens; she suddenly looks down and,,,,,,
sees she is now clothed in a blood-red wedding dress.,,,,,,
Lydia screams!!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
No... No!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam's eyes widen.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
(frightened, but,,,,,
hurling the incan-,,,,,,
tation to make him,,,,,,
disappear),,,,,,
No... Betelgeuse.  Bet...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse waves a hand and Lydia's mouth freezes.,,,,,,
Delia and Charles plead with the recovering Maitlands.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(frantic),,,,,,
Please, can't you do something!,,,,,
Please!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BARBARA AND ADAM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam, not fully recovered, heroically tries to speak --,,,,
but his jaw falls off.  An exhausted Barbara tries to,,,,,,
help him reattach it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse looks at Lydia.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
You know if we're going to get,,,,,,
married, we're going to need,,,,,
witnesses!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse shifts his glare to Charles and Delia.,,,,,,
From Behind, Delia's horrid sculptures come to life,,,,,
and attack Charles and Delia.  The sculptures twist,,,,,,
around them, forcing them to watch the hideous,,,,,
spectacle.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam and Barbara are rapidly trying to recover as the,,,,,,
ceremony begins.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A DEATH-MASKED OLD PREACHER,,,,,,
,,,,,,
slides down the fireplace, ready to perform the,,,,,
service, speaks with a hissing death rattle.,,,,,
,,,,,,
PREACHER,,,,,,
Do you, Betel...,,,,,
,,,,,,
His mouth drops and is frozen.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Uh-uh!  No one says the B word!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
PREACHER,,,,,,
Do you, _____________, take this,,,,
woman to be your wedded wife?  To,,,,,,
honor...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(interrupting),,,,,,
You betcha!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia screams and struggles.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
PREACHER,,,,,,
And... you?  Do you, Lydia, take,,,,
this man?... er, uh... man... to,,,,,
be your lawful wedded husband?...,,,,,,
In sickness...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia struggles.  Her screams are muffled and distant.,,,,,,
Betelgeuse grabs her and shakes her.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
You don't have to answer him,,,,,,
snookums.  I'll do it for you.,,,,,,
(eerily, speaking in,,,,,
her voice),,,,,,
I'm Lydia Deetz and I'm of sound,,,,,,
mind.  The man next to me is the,,,,,,
one I want.  You asked me... I'm,,,,,,
answering.  Yes.  How I love that,,,,,,
man of mine.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam, now fully regenerated, moves toward them.  He,,,,
shouts the incantation.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
Beetle...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse turns to him and with a sweep of his hand,,,,,,
Adam's teeth (as if they were false), fly out of his,,,,,
mouth and CLATTER to the floor.  Adam, toothless,,,,,
musters up his ghost powers and --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON TEETH - TIGHT -- they rare back and continue,,,,,,
shouting...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
TEETH,,,,,,
Beetleju...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Mayhem breaks out.  A furious Betelgeuse stomps at them,,,,,,
with his feet.  The teeth scuttle under the model.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(angrily, to old man),,,,,
Now move it, pops!,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON ADAM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Speechless, Adam heroically charges toward Betelgeuse,,,,,
ready to strike him.  Betelgeuse spins on him and waves,,,,,,
his hand.  SOUND OF RUSHING WIND.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON ADAM,,,,,,
,,,,,,
He has been zapped into his model town.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara screams and jumps at Betelgeuse.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Beetlegeuse...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse turns on her, eyes flashing.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A gag comes over her mouth.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON MODEL,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam is running around the streets trying to get out of,,,,,,
the model.  He looks up into the sky, sees a red glow,,,,,
and THUNDERING WEDDING MUSIC.  He doesn't know what to,,,,,,
do.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She tears away her face (like tissue) and tries to say,,,,,,
his name again...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Betelgeuse...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
More angry, he waves his hand.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Her lips are zippered shut.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
IN MODEL,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Desperate, Adam gets an idea.  He runs over to the,,,,,
truck Betelgeuse had crashed earlier, jumps in and,,,,,
tries to start it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She unzips her mouth and tries again.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
Be,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Fire darts from his eyes....,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A chromium steel plate is riveted across her mouth.,,,,,,
She screams wordlessly behind it.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
IN MODEL,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam finally gets the truck started.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Struggling with her mouth, frustrated to the breaking,,,,,
point, she looks all around the room and rushes to the,,,,,
window and CRASHES through into the night.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
IN MODEL,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Adam sees Barbara rush out.  He looks back at,,,,,,
Betelgeuse, floors the gas pedal and goes for one last,,,,,
shot.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
(angry),,,,,,
Now, let's get rolling!,,,,,
,,,,,,
PREACHER,,,,,,
Then, by the authority vested in,,,,,
me by...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A RUMBLE comes from outside.  Everyone notices but the,,,,,,
Preacher.  He stutters to finish the wedding.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
By me!  Get on with it!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LOUDER NOISE from outside.  Now nearly DEAFENING.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
PREACHER,,,,,,
Yes... by him.  I now pronounce,,,,,,
you man and...,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
The truck is racing up to Betelgeuse's foot.  Adam,,,,,,
bails out just in time as the truck hits Betelgeuse's,,,,,,
foot and EXPLODES, giving him a distracting hot foot,,,,,
then --,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON WINDOW,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Through it -- amidst a cloud of yellow dust -- CRASHES,,,,,,
the sand worm.  Barbara rides him bareback.  Barbara,,,,,,
struggles to control the ROARING worm.  She pulls on,,,,,,
his ears and looks around for Beetle Juice.  Seeing,,,,,,
him, she spurs the Worm after Beetle Juice.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Beetle Juice struggles, trying to run from the worm.,,,,,
But Barbara and the worm outmaneuver him, corner him,,,,,
and when the worm reaches him, he opens his hungry,,,,,
mouth and gulps Betelgeuse in one mouthful.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BETELGEUSE,,,,,,
Rrrrat shit!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Barbara leaps off, as the Sand Worm continues down,,,,,
through the floorboards of the house,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Betelgeuse is gone.  Adam is back to full size.,,,,,,
Charles and Delia are no longer held by the sculptures.,,,,,,
Lydia runs back to her family and Adam and Barbara.,,,,,,
The dust settles.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON HOLE - JUNO,,,,,,
,,,,,,
peers into the room.  She pulls the whores through the,,,,,,
hole.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
FADE OUT.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
FADE IN:,,,,,,

BIRDS SING.  Ernie polishes the lion.  Old Bill sleeps.,,,,,,
People stroll.,,,,,,

EXT. MISS SHANNON'S BOARDING SCHOOL - DAY,,,,,,

A lovely white boarding school with long, green lawn.,,,,,
A BELL RINGS.  Girls come out the front door.  Say,,,,,,
goodbyes.  Lydia walks out too, carrying books.,,,,,

LYDIA,,,,,,
'Bye, Serena.  See you later.,,,,,

EXT. JANE BUTTERFIELD'S ANTIQUES/TRAVEL/REAL ESTATE,,,,,,

,,,,,,
JANE,,,,,,
What do you mean no?  After all,,,,,,
I've done for you.  I don't do,,,,,,
this for my health you know.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CAMERA EXPLORES a row of photographs of houses for,,,,,,
sale.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON PHOTOGRAPH -- of the old Maitland house.  It is,,,,,,
delapidated and haunted-looking.  A legend reads:,,,,,,
"Fixer-Upper's Special.""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
BACK TO JANE -- she is frustrated.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
JANE,,,,,,
I have here a bona fide offer of,,,,,,
$250 ,000.00 for that dump.,,,,,
,,,,,,
Little Jane is now at the Xerox machine.  The NOISE,,,,,,
irritates Big Jane and she throws a wad of paper at,,,,,,
Little Jane.  Little Jane gets mad and throws her,,,,,,
papers into the air and exits.,,,,,,

,,,,,,
INT. NEW YORK APARTMENT - DAY,,,,,,
,,,,,,
We recognize the furniture.  It's the Deetzes'.  Delia,,,,,,
is on the phone to Jane.  Charles comes in with the,,,,,,
Wall Street Journal.  He fidgets, taps his fingers, as,,,,
he reads and pours coffee -- all at once.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
DELIA,,,,,,
(whisper to Charles),,,,,,
It's Mrs. Butterworth again.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Charles picks up the extension.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CHARLES,,,,,,
Listen to me, Jane.  We don't want,,,,,
anyone looking at the house.  We,,,,,,

mowed, the trees trimmed, nor do,,,,
we want it termite inspected.,,,,,,
It's not for sale.,,,,,,

BARBARA,,,,,,
How'd you do on the science test?,,,,,,

ON LYDIA,,,,,,

It was gross.  They wanted me to,,,,,,
dissect a frog.  I told them no,,,,,,

religion.  I got a C.,,,,,,

Adam frowns a little.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
BARBARA,,,,,,
How did you do on the math test?,,,,,,

Lydia looks down coyly.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
We studied all day yesterday.,,,,,,
Don't tell me...,,,,,,

They grin with pride.,,,,,,

LYDIA,,,,,,

So can I?,,,,,,

ADAM,,,,,,
(shaking his head),,,,,,
Uh-uh.  Only if you got above a C,,,,,,
on science.,,,,,,

LYDIA,,,,,,
Oh, go on...,,,,,

BARBARA,,,,,,
Oh, Adam, don't tease her.  You,,,,
never got an A in science in your,,,,,,
life!,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
All right.,,,,,,

ON LYDIA -- she puts down her books.  Loosens her,,,,,,
collar, ruffles her hair and waits.,,,,,
,,,,,,
ADAM,,,,,,
(continuing),,,,,,
Okay.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Lydia looks down.  Lydia begins to levitate.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
She lifts her head and leaves the white bread world,,,,,,
behind!  In a voice as deep and soulful as Percy,,,,,,
Sledge:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
LYDIA,,,,,,
When a man loves a woman.,,,,,,
"He can't keep his mind on nothin' else.""""",,,,,,
,,,,,,
Behind her ghostly images of the football players,,,,,,
appear as back-up.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
FOOTBALLERS,,,,,,
Oooooo.  Hummm oooooo.,,,,,,

LYDIA,,,,,,
He'd change the world for the good,,,,,,
thing he's found.  When a main,,,,,,
needs a woman, He cain't keep his,,,,,
mind on nothin' else.  If she's,,,,,,
bad, he won't see it, she can do,,,,
no wrong.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
MUSIC CONTINUES OVER:,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A great pile of sand with the whorehouse in the,,,,,,
middle.  An irritated Betelgeuse crawls out on the,,,,,,
roof.  Hating the singing he shakes his fist at the,,,,,,
sky -- loses his footing and tumbles into the sand.,,,,,,
Terrified, he scrambles to get out.,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ON PILE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
A moving coil under the sand sends him scurrying inside,,,,,,
again.  The Sandworm SNAPPING right behind him as he,,,,,,
runs back out on the roof.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
,,,,,,
ANGLE,,,,,,
,,,,,,
CAMERA TILTS UP to see house.  It is the perfect, New,,,,,
England house.  CAMERA PULLS BACK from the model -- out,,,,,,
the window of the real house.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
Outside the real house -- we see it is dilapidated, and,,,,,
undeniably, the perfect haunted house.,,,,,

One at a time, constants become surreal
One at a time, heart attacks are concealed
I can see that I lose the joys of life
One at a time, suicides are revealed
You will see that I lost another life
But tonight...

[Chorus]
I'll let you tear it up, if you don't wake me up
But if you tear it, we can't repair it
So please, don't wake me 'til someone cares
Now, no one cares

[Verse 2]
One at a time, I watched them all forget
One at a time, I'm lost in little deaths
It's the place that I, I forget my life
Like tonight...

[Chorus]
I'll let you tear it up, if you don't wake me up
But if you tear it, we can't repair it
So please, don't wake me 'til someone cares
Now, no one cares

[Bridge]
Will the flood behind me put out the fire inside me?
Will the flood behind me put out the fire inside me?

[Chorus]
I'll let you tear it up
I'll let you break it up, if you don't wake me up
But if you tear it, we can't repair it
So please, don't wake me 'til someone cares
Now, no one cares, cares

We say things we didn't mean to say
I take it back, I take it all back now

Girl and watch you go
Running through this life, darling

As the tracer glides
In its graceful arc
Send a little prayer out to ya
‘Cross the falling dark

Tell the repo man
And the stars above
That you’re the one I love
Yeeaah
Perfect summers night
Not a wind that breathes
Just the bullets whispering gentle
‘Mongst the new green leaves
There’s things I might have said
Only wish I could
Now I'm leaking life faster
Then I'm leaking blood

Tell the repo man
And the stars above
That you’re the one I love
You’re the one I love
The one I love

Yuuhuu
Yuuhuu

Don’t see Elysium
Don’t see no fiery hell
Just the lights up bright baby
In the bay hotel
Next wave coming in
Like an ocean roar
Won’t you take my hand, darling
On that old dancefloor

We can twist and shout
Do the turtle dove
And you’re the one I love
You’re the one I love
The one I love

From my snow brigade

You need to see for jealousy
We all know one day you'll leave behind
Your everything and feel the spring come

'Cause I'll find you somewhere
Show you how much I care

I wish they were there to hold you

Trapped by pretty eyes and letters for all time

Her sparkling eyes make me weak at my words, they tremble
Days seem like years in this month of December
The winter coldens me for I have yet to sleep
And never will I give up trying cause you're everything to me

Everything is eclipsed by the shape of destiny

So love me now

Kiss my mouth
Hell is here

Little soldier, little insect, you know war it has no heart
It will kill you in the sunshine or happily in the dark
Where kindness is a card game or a bent-up cigarette
In the trenches, in the hard rain, with a bullet and a bet

He says, ""help me out""
Hell is coming
Could you do it now?
Hell is here

See the sterile soil
Poisoned sky
Yellow water

Bringing new tears

Something has changed within' me
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by the rules of someone else's game

Too late for second guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes and leap

[RACHEL & KURT]
It's time to try defying gravity
I think I'll try defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
And you won't bring me down

[RACHEL]
I'm through accepting limits
'Cause someone says they're so

[KURT]
Some things I cannot change
But till I try, I'll never know

Losing love I guess I've lost

Well, if that's love, it comes at much too high a cost

Sometimes the snow comes down in June
Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon
I see the passion in your eyes
Sometimes it's all a big surprise

Cause there was a time when all I did was wish
You'd tell me this was love
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned
But somehow it's enough

[Chorus]
And now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?
Just when I thought our chance had passed
You go and save the best for last

[Verse 2]
All of the nights you came to me
When some silly girl had set you free
You wondered how you'd make it through
I wondered what was wrong with you

Cause how could you give your love to someone else
And share your dreams with me
Sometimes the very thing you're looking for
Is the one thing you can't see

[Chorus]
But now we're standing face to face
Isn't this world a crazy place?

The cup is not half empty as pessimists say
As far as he sees nothing's left in the cup
A whole cup full of nothing for him to indulge
Since the voice of ambition has long since been shut up

[Chorus 1]
A singer, a writer, he's not dreaming now of going nowhere
He gave heed to nothing, and all that he was is just a tragedy

[Verse 2]
So he voyages in circles and succeeds getting nowhere
And submits to the substance, that first got him there
There, there, there

[Chorus 2]
In violent frustration he cries out to God or just no one
Is there a point to this madness, and all that he was is just a tragedy

[Bridge]
He feels alone
His heart in his hand, he's alone
He feels alone
I feel…

[Verse 3]
Then on that last day he breaks
And he stood tall, and he yelled, and he yelled
(Why world, why world, hate you, hate you, bye world)

Is there a point to this madness, and all that he was is just a tragedy"

Hiding at the bottom of your
Swimming pool some September

Through the center of the storm
And I'm thinking I'd prefer not to be rescued

It happens when you pay attention
Or this could take all year

Jettisoned to the center of the storm

With the pioneers who were flooded from this town
They packed their bags only moments too late
With the pounding waves crashing up against the weakened water gates

Broken hearts tessellate tonight

And all the kids who cut their knees on that old schoolyard fence
Were holding out for posterity and self-defense
We beat them down again
There's no fun in playing cowboys for pretend
We showed them what the backs of our hands is for
The divide is clear in the coming year
The rich will take the poor

No one will play it

I love sleeping in on Saturdays
And I love college football games
I love not acting my age
And good barbecue
Yea I'm a fan of Faulkner books
And anything my mama cooks
Small mouthed bass have got me hooked on Sunday afternoons

[Chorus]
Yes I love good cold beer
And mustard on my fries
I love a good loud Honky Tonk that rocks on Friday nights
And hell yes I love my truck but I want you to know
Honey I love your love the most

Man I love how Redman tastes
Dam I love my Nascar race
Any song sung by George Strait is country at it's best

[Verse 3]
Yea I love scuffed up cowboy boots
And broken torn up jeans
My 4-wheel drive and 8 point bucks
And rocky road ice cream
And hell yes I love my dog
And Jack D in my Coke
But honey I love your love
Yea I love your love

I love your love the most[x2]"

But how can you collect them all and throw them in my face

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting

To keep me right here waiting

I'd still be right here waiting

I hope you're not intending
To be so condescending, it's as much as I can take
But you're so independent
You just refuse to bend so I keep bending until I break

I'm willing to bleed for you
I needed fulfillment
I found what I need in you
Why can't you just forgive me?
I don't want to relive all the mistakes I've made
Along the way
But I always find a way
To keep you right here waiting
I always find the words to say
To keep you right here waiting

But you always find a way
To keep me right here waiting
You always find the words to say
To keep me right here waiting
And if I chose to walk away
Would you be right here waiting?
Searching for the things to say
To keep me right here waiting"

So many nights like this
Let's take a lovers vow
And seal it with a kiss

Untie the balloons from around my neck
And ground me
I'm just a racehorse on the track
Send me back to the glue factory
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my card
To fly the boys home on my own
But you know me, I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone
And the charts are boring, and the kids are snoring
And my ego's in a sling
You say you're not listening and I said I'm wishing
And I said... I said!"

Until the sun came up
And now I'm thinking about
How I wish I could go back
Just for one more day
One more day with you

When the car broke down
We just kept walking along
Til we hit this town
There was nothing there at all
But that was all okay
We spent all our money on stupid things
But if I looked back now, I'd probably give it all away
Just for one more day
One more day with you

We'd spend our days travelin'
It's not that I don't understand you
It's not that I don't want to be with you
But you only wanted me
The way you wanted me

So, I will head out alone and hope for the best
And we can hang our heads down
As we skip the goodbyes
And you can tell the world what you want them to hear
I've got nothing left to lose, my dear
So, I'm up for the little white lies
But you and I know the reason why
I'm gone, and you're still there
I'm gone, and you're still there
I'm gone, and you're still there

I'll buy a magazine searching for your face
From coast to coast, or whatever I find my place
I'll track you on the radio, and
I'll sign your list in a different name
But as close as I come to you
It's not the same

So, I will head out alone and hope for the best
We can pat ourselves on the back
As say that we tried
And if one of us makes it big
We can spill our regrets
And talk about how the love never dies
But you and I know the reason why
I'm gone, and you're still there
I'm gone, and you're still there
I'm gone, and you're still there

So, steal the show, and do your best
To cover the tracks that I have left
I wish you well and hope you find
Whatever you're looking for
The way I might've changed my mind
But you only showed my the door

So, I will head out alone and hope for the best
We can pat ourselves on the back
And say that we tried
And if one of us makes it big
We can spill our regrets
And talk about how the love never dies
But you and I, you and I know the reason why"

Without a care in the world
Except perhaps for bees and birds

Stay away from sea and sand

Brought back the love, we found trust
Vowed we'd never give it up

1835,836,Rosyln,Bon Iver & St. Vincent,,,"Up with your turret
Aren't we just terrified?
Shale, screen your worry
From what you won't ever find

Don't let it fool you
Don't let it fool you...down
Down's sitting round, folds in the gown

Sea and the rock below
Cocked to the undertow
Bones, blood and teeth erode
With every crashing node

Wings wouldn't help you
Wings wouldn't help you...down
Down fills the ground, gravity's proud

You barely are blinking
Wagging your face around
When'd this just become a mortal home?

Won't, won't, won't, won't

Won't let you talk me
Won't let you talk me down
Will pull it taut, nothing let out"

When the rain won't stop
When you feel unloved
When you try so hard
And it all falls apart
When a promise breaks
When the colors fade
When the world looks grey
And you can't find your way

[Chorus]
I got you ooh
I got you ooh
I got you ooh
Through the darkness
And the heartless
When the rain won't stop
When you feel unloved
When it all falls through
I got you
I will hold your high
I'll be by your side
When it all falls through
I got you

[Verse 2]
When you lose your faith
When you're out of place
When the water's deep
And it's hard to breathe
When the bottles close
When you've lost control
Hope against all hope
So far from home

[Chorus]
I got you ooh
I got you ooh
I got you ooh
Through the darkness
And the heartless
When the rain won't stop
When you feel unloved
When it all falls through
I got you
I will hold your high
I'll be by your side
When it all falls through
I got you

When the rain won't stop
When it all falls through
I got you"

[Verse 1]
I know I stand in line until you think you have the time to spend an evening with me
And if we go some place to dance, I know that there's a chance you won't be leaving with me

[Chorus 1]
Then afterwards we drop into a quiet little place and have a drink or two
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""
I can see it in your eyes, that you despise the same old lies you heard the night before
And though it's just a line to you, for me it's true, and never seemed so right before

[Verse 2]
I practice every day to find some clever lines to say to make the meaning come true
But then I think I'll wait until the evening gets late, and I'm alone with you

[Chorus 2]
The time is right, your perfume fills my head, the stars get red, and, oh, the night's so blue
And then I go and spoil it all by saying somethin' stupid like, ""I love you""

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight

See the vultures circling, dark clouds

And empty-handed after two long years

Before you get a chance to feel it

Free to stand beside the ocean in moonlight
And light myself a smoke beneath the dark Atlantic sky

Tearing lives apart and breaking lots of hearts just to pass the time

Put it all behind me and I'll be just fine

Sometimes I wish that it would rain here
And wash away the west coast dreaming from my eyes

These train conversations are passing me by
And I don't have nothing to say
You get what you pay for
But I just had no intention of living this way

I need a phone call, I need a plane ride
I need a sunburn, I need a raincoat

And I get no answers, and I don't get no change

There's things I remember and things I forget
I miss you, I guess that I should
Three thousand five hundred miles away
But what would you change if you could?

I need a phone call, maybe I should buy a new car
I can always hear a freight train, baby, if I listen real hard
And I wish, I wish it was a small world
Because I'm lonely for the big towns

I'd like to hear a little guitar, I guess it's time to put the top down

Beneath candles
Whispers waltz
Around our dreams

Between two points
Is the line
From me to you

Feet turning black
Is this the path we must walk?
No turning back
Wish I could just hear you talk

From under our feet?
Leaving our skin
And burning coals to meet

How I know your face, all the ways you move
You come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone to make me come alive

[Verse 2]
When the days are long, and the thunder with the storm, can always get me crying
Crying
You can make my bed, I'll fall into it, shattered but not lonely
Lonely
'Cause I never knew a home, until I found your hands
And when I'm weathered
You come to me, you're my best friend

[Pre-Chorus]
And that is why we'll always make it

[Chorus]
How I know your face, all the ways you move, you come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone to make me come alive

[Bridge]
And when we're making love
I'd give up everything up for your touch

[Chorus]
How I know your face, all the ways you move
You come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone to make me come alive

[Outro]
When you go to work all the day I wait
For you to come home, recount our time, in our little place
Our little place, our little place
Our little place, our little place, our little place"
1854,855,My Blue Heaven,Taking Back Sunday,Louder Now,4/2/2007,"[Verse 1]
Two sides twist and then collide
You're calling off the guards (Am I coming?)
I'm coming through (Am I coming?)
Adulteress conditioned to a spin cycled submission
You know, sometimes it just feels better to give in
(Sometimes, it just feels better to give in)

[Chorus]
And it's all too familiar
And it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny
(You I can't deny)

[Verse 2]
Dull heat rises from the sheets
I'm both a patient boy
Well, and a jealous man (Am I coming?)
My double standardized suspicion
Is remedied, oh, my blue heaven
Sometimes, it just feels better to give in
(Sometimes, it just feels better to give in)

[Chorus]
And it's all too familiar
And it happens all the time
All the cards begin to stack up
Twisting heartache into fine
Little pieces that avoid an awful crime
But it's you I can't deny
(You I can't deny)

[Bridge]
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
""You're safe, child, you are safe
(You're safe, child, you are safe)
You're safe, child, you are safe""
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
""You're safe, child, you are safe
You're safe, child, you are
Safe (Safe), safe (Safe)
You are safe""
We swing and we sway
As this tiny voice in my head starts to sing
""You're safe, child, you are safe"" (Am I coming?)
""You're safe, child, you are safe"" (Am I-)
Coming through?

[Outro]
Is this all too familiar?
Does it happen all the time?
I'm just asking you to hear me
Could you please, just once, just hear me?
More than anything you wanted to be right
Still it's you, you, it's you I can't deny
(You I can't deny)
It's you I can't deny"

There's a story
I would like to tell
My problem is
It's one you know too well
It's one you know too well

Ms. Suzy Lee
The one I'm speaking of
The question is
Is she the one I love?
Is she the one I love? (alright)

Is she the one I love?
Is she the one I love?

[Verse 2]
She sent me flowers
With her tears burned inside
And you know what I'd do
I would run and hide
I would run and hide

And the paper
On it was my name
With the question
Do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same? (alright)

[Verse 3]
To end this tale
The one I'm speaking of
I wish I had an answer but I just don't know
Is this really love?
Is this really love?

Is this really love?
Is this really love?"
1857,858,"For Emily, Whenever I May Find Her",Simon & Garfunkel,,10/10/1966,"[Verse 1]
What a dream I had
Pressed in organdy
Clothed in crinoline
Of smoky burgundy
Softer than the rain

[Verse 2]
I wandered empty streets
Down past the shop displays
I heard cathedral bells
Tripping down the alleyways
As I walked on

[Verse 3]
And when you ran to me
Your cheeks flushed with the night
We walked on frosted fields
Of juniper and lamplight
I held your hand

[Verse 4]
And when I awoke
And felt you warm and near
I kissed your honey hair
With my grateful tears
Oh, I love you, girl
Oh, I love you"

Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but wait
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around, and say

That it's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

I'd take another chance, take a fall
Take a shot for you
And I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new - yeah
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue, and you say
I'm sorry like an angel
Heaven let me think was you
But I'm afraid

It's too late to apologize, it's too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late

It's too late to apologize, it's too late

Let's get together and talk about the modern age
All of our friends were gathered there
With their pets, just talking shit
About how we're all so upset
About the disappearing ground
As we watch it melt...

[Chorus]
It's all of the good that won't come out of us
And how eventually, our hands will just turn to dust
If we keep shaking them
Standing here on this frozen lake

[Verse 2]
I do this thing where I think I'm real sick
But I won't go to the doctor to find out about it
'Cause they make you stay real still in a real small space
As they chart up your insides and put them on display
They'd see all of it, all of me, all of it

[Chorus]
All of the good that won't come out of me
And all the stupid lies I hide behind
It's such a big mistake
Lying here in your warm embrace

[Bridge]
Oh, you're almost home
I've been waiting for you to come in
Dancing around in your old suits
Going crazy in your room again
I think I'll go out and embarrass myself
By getting drunk and falling down in the street
You say I choose sadness
That it never once has chosen me
Maybe you're right...

[Verse 3]
Let's talk about all our friends who lost the war
And all of the novels that had yet to be written about them

[Chorus]
It's all of the good that won't come out of them
And all the stupid lies they hide behind
It's such a big mistake
Standing here on this frozen lake

It's all of the good that won't come out of me
And how eventually, my mouth will just turn to dust
If I don't tell you quick
Standing here on this frozen lake"

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I want to quit this all and become an accountant now
But I'm no good at math and besides, the dollar is down
Plant palm trees on Lake Michigan before it gets cold
I gotta feel the wind chill again before I get old

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to scream ""I love you"" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me

[Chorus]
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital, I know we're gonna leave this town
And get new passports and get, get, get, get, get out now

[Verse 2]
All the yes-men said ""no comment,"" my mouth got going
The wrong way and all the calls started snowing
The time my dad caught me a horse shoe crab and I asked him if
Throwing it back into the sea would bring our luck back

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to scream ""I love you"" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me

You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital, I know we're gonna leave this town
And get new passports, get out now

[Bridge]
Tell that boy I'll leave you alone now
Like a stove, I'll turn my love down
Supra and the prophet are both
In the business of souls

[Pre-Chorus]
I want to scream ""I love you"" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me, whoa
I want to scream ""I love you"" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me

[Chorus]
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital, I know we're gonna leave this town
(Know we're gonna leave this town)
And get new passports and get, get, get, get, get out
Get, get, get, get, get out now!

I don't believe
In the smile that you leave me with
When you walk away and say goodbye
Well, I don't expect
The world to move underneath me
But for God's sake, could you try?
I know that you're true to me
You're always there, you say you care
I know that you wanna be mine

[Chorus]
Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need?
I want your heart to bleed
And that's all I'm asking for
Oh, where is your heart?

[Verse 2]
I don't understand
Your love is so cold
It's always me that's reaching out for your hand
And I've always dreamed
That love would be effortless
Like a petal falling to the ground
A dreamer following his dream

[Chorus]
Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you
Is it so hard to give me what I need?
I want your heart to bleed
And that's all I'm asking for
Oh, where is your heart?

It seems so much is left unsaid (So much is left unsaid)
But you can say anything
Oh, anytime you need
Baby, it's just you and me
Oh, yeah

I know that you're true to me
You're always there
You say you care
I know that you wanna be mine

Where is your heart?

Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you (To believe you)
Is it so hard to give me what I need?
I want your heart to bleed
And that's all I'm asking for
Yeah
Where is your heart?
'Cause I don't really feel you
Where is your heart?
What I really want is to believe you (To believe you)
Is it so hard to give me what I need?

Maybe it's love but it's like you said... love is like a role that we play
But I believe in you so much I could die for the words that you say
But I believe in you so much I could die from the words that you say

But you're chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing is getting away from you again while you're chasing ghosts

I guess it's luck, but it's the same hard luck you've been trying to tame
Maybe it's love but it's like you said... love is like a role that we play
But I believe in you so much I could die for the words that you say
But I believe in you so much I could die from the words that you say

But you're chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing is getting away from you again while you're chasing ghosts

Just bend the pieces 'til they fit, like they were made for it
But they weren't meant for this
No, they weren't meant for this
Just bend the pieces 'til they fit, like they were made for it
But they weren't meant for this

Chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing is getting away, away, away, away from you again
Chasing the ghost of a good thing
Haunting yourself as the real thing is getting away from you again while you're chasing ghosts"

All the boys got the same girls' hair
And I am bored because I feel much older
Look at me as if I got a reason to stare
But you talk so loud that it calms me down
You're crying, ""Let's make a toast!""

[Chorus]
She says she's leaving on a Sunday
Oh, that leaves me one more night
Can I take you home?
I know it's wrong, but I know your type

She says she's leaving on a Sunday
I don't care, I need to know where to turn
I tried it once, it never caught on
I was the only one who got burned

I've read every word you've said
From a poster of a cat
Four books look across your sofa
I thought your coffee table was more clever than that
It gets worse once we get to her room
She stops and she sings, ""Do do do do do do do do""
I claim ""New Religion"" is my song
She doesn't get it
It's all before she was born

And you lock your door
Like I've been here before
I feel like I've seen a ghost

[Chorus]

Suddenly between sheets and eyelids
I am reminded why I don't do this
I fall in love far too quickly
I never want her to forget me
When you're gone
Will you call, will you write?

[Chorus]

She says she's leaving on a Sunday
I don't care, I need to know where to turn
I tried it once, it never caught on
I was the only one who got burned
I was the only one who got burned
I was the only one who got burned
I was the only one who got burned"

1866,867,Future Foe Scenarios,Silversun Pickups,Carnavas,5/21/2007,"The things we laid do not amount to much
Made of abandoned wood, loose stones, and such

This revolution, baby
Proves who you work for lately

Release the castaways who run amok
From self-appointed winds which blow and such
When present tense gets strangled in the mire
Made of our cozy decomposing wires

Who do you work for, baby?
And does it work for you lately?

But when the night is over and the walls start burning
When fire starts to matter and the clock's still churning
Clichés and other chatter keeps our minds from learning
Our minds keep learning

It's alright, it's alright

The things we laid do not amount to much
Made up of thought balloons and cotton swabs
When present tense gets strangled in the woes
Made of our future foe scenarios

This revolution, baby
Proves who you work for maybe
Who do you work for, baby?
And does it work for you lately

But when the night is over and the walls start linking
When fire starts to matter and the clock's still sinking
Clichés and other chatter keeps our minds from thinking
Our minds keep shrinking

It's alright, it's alright
It's alright. It's alright

That's when it turned on me
A motorcade of 'meant to be's’
Parades of beauty queens
Where soft entwines make kindling
These many detailed things
Like broken nails and plastic rings
Will win by keeping me
From speaking to my new darling

And there's no way to know
Our future foe scenarios
That's when it turned on me
Where bobby pins held angel wings"
1867,868,Own It,Drake,Nothing Was the Same,9/24/2013,"[Produced by Noah ""40"" Shebib & PARTYNEXTDOOR]

[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it
It's yours
It's yours

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yours... You're still the one that I adore
Ain't much out there to have feelings for
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is? Yours
A few bottles on the table, a few waters
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours
Next time we fuck, I don't wanna fuck, I wanna make love
Next time we talk, I don't wanna just talk, I wanna trust
Next time I stand tall, I wanna be standin' for you
And next time I spend I want it all to be for you
Peakin', I'm peakin'
Wake up with me this weekend, we can, oh
Guess whose it is? Guess whose it is?
Guess whose it is? It's yours

[Hook: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit
Go and own that shit, own that shit, own that shit, you own that shit, go and

[Verse 2: Drake]
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Just let that shit sink in, ha!
Niggas talk more than bitches these days
Who could get the pussy quicker these days
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story
My ex-girl been searchin' for a ""sorry""
Couple bitches tryna have me on the Maury
Like nigga it's yours, you should be supportin'
But where you been at? On tour, gettin' money
Y'all don't even really check for me
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me, girl
You don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me, girl
Cause you got the Batphone and my workline, you should call
When the last time you did somethin' for the first time?
You done done it all
I swear to God, niggas talk more than bitches these days
Got you thinkin' that I'm different these days
Broken telephone for every single conversation
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days
It's yours, it's yours, it's yours, it's... it's always gonna be yours

[Outro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, own it, I said
Go own that shit, it's yours, it's yours, own it, own it, own it, own it
Own it, baby, own it, it's yours, own that shit, own that shit, own that shit"
1868,869,Be Still,The Killers,Battle Born,9/17/2012,"[Verse 1]
Be still
Go on to bed
Nobody knows what lies ahead
Life is short to say the least
We're in the belly of the beast
Be still, wild and young
Long may your innocence reign
Like shells on a shore
May your limits be unknown
May your efforts be your own
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore

[Chorus]
Don't break character
You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Rise up like the sun
Labor till the work is done

[Verse 2]
Be still
One day you'll lead
Fearlessness on your sleeve
When you come back, tell me what did you see
Was there something out there for me
Be still
Close your eyes
Soon enough, you'll be on your own, steady and straight
And if they drag you through the mud
It doesn't change what's in your blood
Over rock, over chain
When they knock you down

[Chorus]
Don't break character
You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Rise up like the sun
Labor till the work is done

[Bridge]
Over rock and chain
Over sunset plane
Over trap and snare
When you're in too deep
In your wildest dreams
In your made up schemes
When they knock you down
When they knock you down

[Chorus]
Don't break character
You've got a lot of heart
Is this real or just a dream
Rise up like the sun
Labor till the work is done"
1869,870,Just The Way You Are,Barry White,The Collection,9/22/1978,"(Speaking)
I never take anything for granted
Only a fool maybe takes things for granted
Just because it's here today
It can be gone tomorrow
And that's one thing that you
Never in your life ever have to worry about me
If I'll ever change towards you because
Baby I love you
Yeah I love you
Just the way... You are...

Don't go changing, trying to please me
You never let me down before
I don't imagine you're too familiar
And I don't see you anymore
I would not leave you in times of trouble
We never could have come this far
I took the good times, I'll take the bad times
I'll take you just the way you are

Don't go trying some new fashion
Don't change the color of your hair
You always have my unspoken passion
Although I might not seem to care

I don't want clever conversation
I don't want to work that hard
I just want some someone to talk to
I want you just the way you are

I need to know that you will always be
The same old someone that I knew
What will it take till you believe in me
The way that I believe in you

I said I love you and that's forever
And this I promise from my heart
I could not love you any better
I love you just the way you are"
1870,871,Anytime,Brian McKnight,Anytime,9/23/1997,"[Verse 1]
I can't remember why we fell apart
From something that was so meant to be, yeah
Forever was the promise in our hearts
Now more and more I wonder where you are

[Chorus]
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
I miss you

[Verse 2]
Still have your picture in a frame
Hear your footsteps down the hall
I swear I hear your voice, driving me insane
How I wish that you would call to say

[Chorus]
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
I miss you

[Verse 3]
I miss you, I miss you
No more loneliness and heartache
No more crying myself to sleep
Don't want no more wondering about tomorrow
Won't you come back to me, come back to me, oh

[Chorus]
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
Do you ever wake up reaching out for me?
Do I ever cross your mind anytime?
I miss you

[Outro]
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you"
1871,872,We All Want Love,Rihanna,Talk That Talk,11/1/2012,"[Intro]
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all
We all, we all, we all, we all, we all

[Verse 1]
I can pretend that I'm not lonely
But I'll be constantly fooling myself
I can pretend that it don't matter
But I'll be sitting here lying to myself
Some say love ain't worth the buck
But I'll give every dime I have left
To have what I've only been dreaming about

1872,873,Someone Else's Life,Joshua Radin,We Were Here,,"Somehow I'm leading someone else's life
I cut a star down with my knife

And right now
I still see the way the moon
Plays this tune
Though our nights died

My hands shake, my knees quake
It's every day, the same way
Cause then came you, then there's you
I keep your picture in my worn through shoes
Then there's you then came you
When I'm lost I look at my picture of you

And somehow
I'll make tonight our own
I'll show you every way I've grown
Since I met you

And right now
I'll be the boy in your next song
I'll learn the parts and play along
If you let me

My hands shake, my knees quake
It's every day, the same way
Cause then came you, then there's you
I keep your picture in my worn through shoes
Then there's you then came you
When I'm lost I look at my picture of you

If you let me, I'll show the world to you
Yes if you let me, I'll know just what to do

Cause then came you, then there's you
I keep your picture in my worn through shoes

When I'm lost in your eyes
I see a way for me"

Consider this a letter that I never sent
However inconsiderate it seems
Do you still consider me
Consider me the boy you laughed with
Or you learned to live without?
I suck
I know I'm late
I know you waited
You wouldn't get me on the phone
And you couldn't make me not alone

The phone bill's stacked up by my bedside
With your picture, you're looking surprised
You're what makes
New England so great
My Island nights are all spent dying
Wait for summer
To become wrought with lips
(My wishful thinking)

You wouldn't get me on the phone
And you couldn't make me not alone
Yeah, you wouldn't get me
You wouldn't get me
You wouldn't get me on the phone

Yeah, you're a blue-eyed lightning bolt
I'm a national phenomenon
Nothing's absolutely definite
Till it's absolutely, definitely gone

I never thought this day would end
(Never thought this day would end)
I never thought tonight could ever be this close to me
So let my hands stray
Past the boundaries of your back
And get you breathing
And get this started

You wouldn't get me
You wouldn't get me
You wouldn't get me on the phone
Yeah you wouldn't get me
You wouldn't get me
You wouldn't get me on the phone
Yeah, you're a blue-eyed lightning bolt

Sunrise, sunset
Swiftly go the days
Sunrise, sunset
You wake up, then you undress
It always is the same
The sunrise and the sunsets
You are lying while you confess, keep trying to explain
The sunrise and the sunsets
You realize then you forget what you've been trying to retain
But everybody knows that it is all about the things
That get stuck inside of your head
Like the songs your roommate sings
Or a vision of her body as she stretches out on your bed
She raised her hands in the air, asked you
When was the last time you looked in the mirror?
Cause you've changed
Yeah, you've changed


Sunrises, sunsets
You're hopeful then you regret
The circle never breaks
With a sunrise and a sunset there's a change of heart or address
Is there nothing that remains?
For a sunrise or a sunset
You're manic or you're depressed
Will you ever feel ok?
For a sunrise or a sunset, your lover is an actress
Did you really think she'd stay?
For a sunrise or a sunset
You're either coming or you just left but you're always on the way
Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet
They are really just the same
To the sunrise and the sunset
The master and his servant have exactly the same fate
It's a sunrise and a sunset
From a cradle to a casket
There is no way to escape
The sunrise and the sunset
Hold your sadness like a puppet, keep putting on the play
But everything you do is leading to the point
Where you just won't know what to do
And at that moment you may laugh
But there is someone there who will be laughing louder than you
So it's true, the trick is complete
Become everything you said you never would be
You're a fool! You're a fool!

But could not count to ten
Now she got lots of different horses
By lots of different men

Nothing sacred, but it's a living

Got no self-esteem and vertigo

Got a hurricane at back of her throat
She thinks she's made of candy

Whoever gets the closest
She comes and she goes
As the war of the roses
Mother was a victim
Father beat the system
By moving bricks to Brixton
And learning how to fix them

I'm trying to keep my back from wall
The prophets and their pawns have had another success
I'm wondering why we bother at all

And I think of you on cold winter mornings
Darling they remind me of when we were at school
Nothing really mattered when you called out my name
In fact Nothing really mattered at all

And I think about how long it will take them to blow us away
But I won't get me down
I'm just thankful to facing the day
Cause days don't get you far when you're gone

It's 5 o' clock on a Friday morning
One hundred telephones sit and ring
One of them's from someone who knew you
And I still think of you on cold winter mornings

Darling they'll still remind me of when we were at school
When they could never have persuaded me that lives like yours were in the hands of these erroneous fools
And to those of you who live your lives from one day to the next
Well, let them take you to next
Can't you live and be thankful you're here?
See it could be you tomorrow, next year"

Many miles from where I'm sleeping
You share laughter in the evenings
As do I, in the great divine
Yours is mine

All wrapped in bones of setting sun
All dust and stone and moribund
I paid twenty-five cents to light
A little white candle
For a New Year's Day
I sat and watched it burn away
Then turned and weaved
Through slow decay
We were both a little hungry
So we went to get hot dog

Down to Hyde Street Pier
The light was slight and disappeared
The air it stunk of fish and beer
We heard a Superman trumpet
Play the national anthem

And the world may be long for you
But'll never belong to you
But on a motorbike
When all the city lights
Blind your eyes tonight
Are you feeling better now?

Some way to greet the year:
Your eyes all bright and
Brim with tears
The pilgrims, pills, and tourists here
Will sink fifty-three bucks to buy
A brand new halo

Sweet on a green-eyed girl
All fiery Irish clip and curl
All brine and piss and vinegar
I paid twenty-five cents to light
A little white candle

And the world may be long for you
But'll never belong to you
But on a motorbike
When all the city lights
Blind your eyes tonight
Are you feeling better now?"

I'm up and doing circles
I am taken, I am yours

I'm up and doing circles
I am taken, I am yours
(If you go, you go)

(If you go, you go)
I'm up and doing circles

I collapse
I might stay out longer then
I left a light on for you then
If you show, you show
If you show, you show

When I feel like this
When I get so into myself
I lose track of where I'm going then
Lose track of how to get going again
I feel myself slowing down
Feel myself turning round
Is this taken?

When I feel like this
When I get so sick of myself
Where are you going then
Without me and not knowing then
That we're slowing down
You've got to turn right around
And tell me that I'm taken then
Tell me if I'm yours

You collapse
The pressure of this life is so
You can't be held accountable
If you go, you go
If you go, you go

When you act like this
When you get so sick of yourself
The whole world falls away and since
I feel like I have only missed
The feeling that I'm here again
The feeling that I'm clear again
I'm not taken

When you act like this
When you get so into yourself
I lose sight of common goals
And letting go, so I can be all alone
Feel myself going slow
Feel myself letting go
Not taken
Not feeling like I'm yours

I am taken, I am yours

I am taken, I am yours
(If you go, you go)
I'm up and doing circles

I collapse
This life looks like a sentence
Though a constant game of falling short
If you know, you know
If you know, you know

When I feel like this
When I'm just so sick of feeling less than perfect
Isn't right for me
I never fight to see
If coming clean would get to me
I feel myself holding back
I feel the pressure, it's finally back
I'm taken

When you felt like this
When you saw it all come crashing down
Subtle but not underground
I was there, I saw the signs
I saw unfair and so
I write to you through other means
I let myself finally feel taken
Like I was yours

I am taken, I am yours
(I feel sick)
I'm up and doing circles
(I feel)

I collapse

Yet through it all
This much remains

When I'm more than I thought I could be
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away

When I'm racing with destiny

I will feel
I will feel eternity

My head is a carousel of pictures
The spinning never stops
I just want someone to walk in front
And I'll follow the leader
Like when I fell under the weight of a schoolboy crush
Started carrying her books and doing lots of drugs. I almost forgot who I was
But came to my senses
Now I'm tryin' to be assertive
I'm making plans
Wanna rise to the occasion, yeah
Meet all of their demands
But all I do is just lay in bed
And hide under the covers
I know I should be brave
But I'm just too afraid of all this change
And it's too hard to focus through all this doubt
I keep making these ""To Do"" lists but nothing gets crossed out
Working on the record seems pointless now
When the world ends, who's gonna hear it?
But Im tryin' and take some comfort in written words
Yeah Tim I heard your album and it's better than good
When you get off tour I think we should hang and black out together
Because I've been feeling sentimental for days gone by...
All those summers singing, drinking, laughing, wasting out time
Remember all those songs and the way we smiled
In those basements made of music
But now I've got to crawl, to get anywhere at all. I'm not as strong as I thought
So when I'm lost in a crowd
I hope that you'll pick me out
Oh, how I long to be found
The grass grew high. I laid down
Now I wait for a hand to lift me up, help me stand
I have been laying so low
Don't want to lay here no more
Don't want to lay here no more
Don't want to lay here no more
Don't want to lay here no more
But if everything that happens is supposed to be
And it is predetermined, can't change your destiny
Then I guess I'll just keep moving, someday, maybe, I'll get to where I'm going"

1916,917,Cleanse Song,Bright Eyes,Cassadaga,4/10/2007,"Hear the chimes, did you know that the wind when it blows
It is older than Rome and all of this sorrow
See the new Pyramids down in old Manhattan
From the roof of a friend's, I watched an empire ending
Heard it loud and long, the river's song
Time marching on, to a mad man's drum

Don't forget what you've learned
All you give is returned
And if life seems absurd
What you need is some laughter
And a season to sleep
And a place to get clean
Maybe Los Angeles
Somewhere no one's expecting

On a detox walk
Through a Glendale Park
Over sidewalk chalk
Some wrote in red, ""start over""

So I muffle my scream
On an Oxnard beach
Full of fevered dreams that scare you sober
Into saltless dinners

Take the fruit from the tree, break the skin with your teeth
Is it bitter or sweet all depends on your timing
Like a meeting of chance
With a train station glance
Many lifetimes have passed in a instant reminded
Of a millstone house in a seaside town
When your heart gave out in a mission bed

So your wife gave birth to a funeral dirge
As you woke up purged as a wailing infant
In Krung Thep, Thailand

Hear the chimes, did you know that the wind when it blows
It is older than Rome and our joy and our sorrow"

For something that I did not do

Maybe it’s the chase that really gets me off
I fall so when it’s just not there

Faces long and grim
Souls are feeling heavy
And faith is growing thin
Fears are getting stronger
You can feel them on the rise
Hopelessness got some by the throat you can see it in their eyes

I said how come
How come

Everybody on a shoestring
Everybody in a hole
Everybody on an old jet plane crossing their fingers and toes
Government man spin his politics till they got you pinned
Everybody trying to reach out to each other
But they don't know where to begin
I said how come
I can't tell
The free world
From living hell
I said how come
How come
All I see
Is a child of god
In misery
I said how come

The pistol now as prophet
The bullet some kind of lord and king
But pain is the only promise that this so called savior is gonna bring
Love can be a liar
And justice can be a thief
And freedom can be an empty cup from which everybody want to drink

I said how come
I can't tell
The free world
From living hell
I said how come
How come
All i see
Is a child of god
In misery
I said how come

It's just man killing man
Killing man
Killing man
Killing man
I don't understand it

It's just man killing man
Killing man
Killing man

Nod my head so dumb with love
There's something else I'm dreaming of
Shut my eyes pretend it's there
Keep me here, unaware

It's not where we left it at
I can see the love we trapped
Coming back

Magnify for us to see, then dig them up desperately

You plus me is bad news
But you're a lovely creation and I like to think that I am too
But my friend said I look better without you

Crying 'what a shame' as she slipped in the rain

And never shine on me

Was the beautiful one that was you
Since you went away
It's nighttime all day
And it's usually raining, too…

How could it shine down on everyone
And never shine on me
How could there be
Such cruelty

Were shining in your eyes
There is no sun except the one
That never shone on other guys
The moon to whom the poets croon
Has given up and died
Astronomy will have to be revised…

Not much of a girlfriend
I never seem to get a lot (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

It's been some time since we last spoke
This is gonna sound like a bad joke
But Momma, I fell in love again
It's safe to say I have a new girlfriend
And I know it sounds so old
But Cupid got me in a chokehold
And I'm afraid I might give in
Towel's on the mat, my white flag is wavin' (Mbabarara)
I mean, she even cooks me pancakes
And Alka-Seltzer when my tummy aches
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is
We even got a secret handshake
And she loves the music that my band makes
I know I'm young, but if I had to choose her or the sun
I'd be one nocturnal son of a gun (Mbabarara, mbabarara)

And I know you heard the last song
About the girls that didn't last long
But I promise this is on a whole new plane
I can tell by the way she says my name (Mbabarara)
I love the way she calls my phone
She's even got her very own ringtone
If that ain't love then I don't know what love is (Mbabarara)
It's gonna be a long drive home
But I know as soon as I arrive home
And I open the door, take off my coat, and throw my bag on the floor
She'll be back into my arms once more for sure like

She's got porcelain skin, of course she's a ten
Now she's even got her own song (But movin' on)
She's got the cutest laugh I ever heard
And we can be on the phone for three hours (Not sayin' one word)
And I would still cherish every moment
And when I start to build my future, she's the main component

One more fight, yeah, you tell me all the time
How do I swallow my pride?

But she's the one, she's the one
But she's the one, she's the one

Time and time I hear things that can't be true
And it's only talk 'cause she'll never be so cruel
Every night there's a new name on her arm
That I don't think I recognize
And it's never strange just how long she stays away
I guess I'll have to compromise

We've got big black cars

Drink my worries down the drain
And fly away to somewhere new

Hop on my choo-choo

They left the television screaming that the radio's on
Someone stole my shoes
But there's a couple of bananas and a bottle of booze

Oh well, Happy New Year's, baby
We could probably fix it if we clean it up all day
Or we could simply pack our bags
And catch a plane to Barcelona 'cause this city's a drag

Can't breathe when I'm around her
I wait here everyday in case
She scratched the surface
She'll never notice

[Chorus]
I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words about a girl
(hey!)

[Verse 2]
Last night I knew what to say
But you weren't there to hear it
These lines so well rehearsed, tongue-tied
And overloaded
You never notice

[Chorus]
I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words about a girl
I'm not in love
This is not your song
I'm not gonna waste these words about a girl

[Bridge]
To be loved, to be loved
What more could you ask for?
To be loved, to be loved
Everyone wants
To be loved, to be loved
What more could you ask for?
To be loved, to be loved
Everyone
I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words...

[Chorus]
I'm not in love
This is not my heart
I'm not gonna waste these words about a girl
I'm not in love
(To be loved, to be loved, what more
Could you ask for)
This is not my heart
(To be loved, to be loved, everyone
Wants to be loved)
I'm not gonna waste these words about a girl

1943,944,Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?,Bryan Adams,18 Til I Die,4/4/1995,"[Verse 1]
To really love a woman
To understand her - You gotta know her deep inside
Hear every thought - See every dream
And give her wings when she wants to fly
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Verse 2]
To really love a woman - Let her hold you
'Til you know how she needs to be touched
You've gotta breathe her - really taste her
'Til you can feel her in your blood
And when you can see your unborn children in her eyes
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that you'll always be together
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Bridge]
Oh - You got to give her some faith - Hold her tight
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you
You really gotta love your woman

Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms
You know you really love a woman

[Chorus]
When you love a woman
You tell her that she's really wanted
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one
'Cause she needs somebody
To tell her that it's gonna last forever
So tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?

[Outro]
Yeah, just tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?
Oh, just tell me have you ever really
Really, really ever loved a woman?"

[Verse 1]
If I could write, I'd tell you how much I've missed these nights
Where we'd dig around the bones
And try to find peace and patches for the holes
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter
The corner boys told her how I was dyin' to meet her
Like a prayer I said on a dead man's knee
You drove up like a parade

[Chorus]
You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart straight in my arms
Fell straight in my arms

[Verse 2]
And I miss it sometimes
Shakin' like a leaf on the corner of Vine
But I heard it's alright
The radio spoke to a good friend of mine
And I can feel it comin' up as the night's gettin' warm
I saw your summer dress hangin' on the back of the lawn
Like a dream I remember from an easier time
With the top rolled down on a Saturday night

[Chorus]
You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart right in my arms
Right in my arms

[Bridge]
And I always dreamed of classic cars and movie screens
And tryin' to find some way to be redeemed
Bring a dollar with you, baby
In the cold, cold ground

[Chorus]
You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart

You and your high-top sneakers and your sailor tattoos
And your old fifty-five that you drove through the roof
Of the sky up above these indifferent stars
While you just kept coming apart
You fell straight in my arms
You fell straight in my arms"

Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe in how

Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe in how

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around now, it may show

Last night I dreamt that I was you
I was dressed all in black with dark glasses and attitude
Such a pose I could simply not hold
Through days in a northern town that I had once called a home
And your studies of fringe New York streets
I was reading the pavement in every word you would speak
To a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on

[Verse 2]
Buying drinks for the poets upstate
The southern corruption tows you down the interstate
And they all said that you were the king
Of a gloomy disruption that surfaced when you would sing
And this town cannot begin to compete
So I'm packing my Bullets and Silvertones and heading east
To a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on
On, on, on, it's...

If I could've had my way
This year would bridge '66 again

Trust fund hipsters were casing the room
Chock-full of amphetamines, the overturned kick drum boom
Set the pace with incomparable cool
And if the tempo was lousy, it was lost on all but you
'Cause your studies of fringe New York streets:
I was reading the pavement in every word you would speak
To a ""brownstone up three flights of stairs"" and it's on
On, on, on, it's on

If I could've had my way
This year would bridge '66 again

Lift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye

[Verse 1]
As a child, there were them times
I didn't get it, but you kept me in line
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings, and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things
Separation brings
You never let me know it
You never let it show because
You loved me and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today face to face

[Chorus]
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
""I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by""
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

[Verse 2]
And you never got the chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever

[Chorus]
I never knew I could hurt like this
And everyday life goes on like
""I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by""
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye (The hardest thing to say, bye bye)
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye, bye bye

[Bridge]
This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man, or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say bye (No, no, no)
Mamas, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky 'cause we will never say bye
Bye

[Chorus]
I never knew I could hurt like this (I never knew it)
And everyday life goes on like
""I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry (I wish)
(I wish) As time goes by""
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still I'd give the world to see your face
And I'm right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye....)

[Outro]
It's hard to say bye bye bye bye bye
So come on, somebody sing it with me
Wave your hands up high
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
So this is for everybody
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
So just keep your hands to the sky
(Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye)
'Cause we will never say bye bye"

Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes

Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor

Found on a beach picked up and you held so close

So where the hell you at?
Just one shot left of this drink, in this glass

Sigilosa al pasar
Sigilosa al pasar
Esa loba es especial
Mirala, caminar, caminar

Quién no ha querido a una diosa licántropa
En el ardor de una noche romántica
Mis aullidos son el llamado
Yo quiero un lobo domesticado

[Pre-Coro]
Por fin he encontrado un remedio infalible
Que borre del todo la culpa
No pienso quedarme a tu lado mirando la tele
Y oyendo disculpas
La vida me ha dado un hambre voraz
Y tú apenas me das caramelos (Ah)
Me voy con mis piernas y mi juventud por ahí
Aunque te maten los celos

Tiene ganas de salir (Ah-ooh)
Deja que se coma el barrio
Antes de irte a dormir

Tengo tacones de aguja magnética
Para dejar la manada frenética
La luna llena como una fruta
No da consejos, ni los escucha

Llevo conmigo un radar especial para localizar solteros
Si acaso me meto en aprietos también
Llevo el número de los bomberos
Ni tipos muy lindos ni divos ni niños ricos yo sé lo que quiero (Ay)
Pasarla muy bien y portarme muy mal
En los brazos de algún caballero

Una loba en el armario
Tiene ganas de salir (Ah-ooh)
Deja que se coma el barrio
Antes de irte a dormir

Duda si andar por la calle o entrar en un bar a probar fortuna
Ya está sentada en su mesa y pone la mira en su próxima presa
Pobre del desprevenido que no se esperaba una de esas

And I'm ill with the thought of your kiss
Coffee-laced, intoxicating on her lips

Shut it out

I'm not allowed
To wear your freedom down, no

And tickle you until you scream

I want to say I do
I want to say I do

I want to be much more like you
The way your smile lights up the room
I'll kick back as men flirt with you
To jealousy I'll stay immune
This confidence in me and you
This hope that you and I will bloom
I want to fall in love with you
I want to say I do

You laugh like a little girl
So you share secrets with Lou
But we've got secrets, too
Well, one: I only keep this heap for you

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't go back, I'm haunted
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Outro]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it"

I got one two three four
Five, six, sick, sick
Running 'round the neighborhood
Pejorative, ""Jinx,"" he said
The groom is down on me, 'cause he ate the rice
It was well-intentioned but bad advice
Hell yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah
Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah

Open the curtain
And let in some sky
It's almost half past two and you
You can tell by the light, oh yeah
Open your window
And let in the atmosphere

Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah
Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah

Open the curtain
And let in some sky
It's almost half past two and you
You can tell by the light
Open your window

Oh, let it break through, oh yeah

[Verse 1]
There's fifty-two ways to murder anyone
One and two are the same and they both work as well
I'm coming clean for Amy
Julie doesn't scream as well and the cops won't listen all night
And so maybe I'll be over
Just as soon as I fill them all in

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can remember when I saw her last
We were runnin' all around and havin' a blast, havin' a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in is so lonely without you
I know when you're home, I was thinkin' about you
There was somethin' I forgot to say, I was cryin' on Saturday night

[Chorus]
I was out cruisin' without you
They were playin' our song
Cryin' on Saturday night

[Verse 2]
As the moon becomes the night time
You go viciously, quietly, away
I'm sitting in the bedroom
Where we used to sit and smoke cigarettes
Now I'm watchin', watchin' you die
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I can remember when I saw her last
We were runnin' all around and havin' a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in is so lonely without you
I know when you're home, I was thinkin' about you
There was somethin' I forgot to say, I was cryin' on Saturday night

I was out cruisin' without you
They were playin' our song
Cryin' on Saturday night
Cryin' on Saturday night

1996,997,You Wanted More,Tonic,Sugar,6/26/1999,"[Verse 1]
Love is tragic, love is bold
You will always do what you are told
Love is hard, love is strong
You will never say that you were wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know when I got bitter
But love is surely better when it's gone

[Chorus]
'Cause you wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live
You wanted more
More than I could bear
More than I could offer
For a love that isn't there

[Verse 2]
Love is color, love is loud
Love is never saying you're too proud
Love is trusting, love is honest
Love is not a hand to hold you down

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I got to pick me up when I am down
I got to get my feet back on the ground
I got to pick me up when I am down

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
You wanted more
More than I could love
More than I could offer
The harder you would shove
You wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live"
1997,998,New Romantic,Laura Marling,My Manic And I,10/29/2007,"[Verse 1]

I know I said I love you, but I'm thinking I was wrong
I'm the first to admit that I'm still pretty young
And I never meant to hurt you when I wrote you ten love songs

That guy that I could never get
His girlfriend was pretty fit
And everyone who knew her loved her so

And I made you leave her for me
And now I'm feeling pretty mean
But my mind has fucked me over more times than any man could ever know

[Pre-Chorus]

Maybe I should give up giving
Give up trying to be thin
Give up and turn into my mother
God knows I love her

[Chorus]

And I'm sorry to whichever man
Should meet my sorry state
Watch my sturdy, lonesome gait
And beware

I will never love a man
Cause love and pain go hand in hand
And I can't do it again

[Verse 2]

So we stayed up late one night
To try and get our problems right
But I couldn't get into his head just what was going through my mind

Thinking he knew where I was going
He put Ryan Adams on
I think he thinks it makes me weaker, but it only ever makes me strong

I've got this friend who sounds just like him
And he's the man I leave you for
The man that I just adore like you

The same man, he turns to me
He said ""I've got to tell you how I feel
If God could make the perfect girl, for me it would be you""

And my God told me not to tell
About how much do you love your fella
I don't know more everyday
Not in this new romantic way

[Pre-Chorus]

I'll always be your first love
You'll always be my first love

[Chorus]

But I'm sorry to whichever man
Should meet my sorry state
Watch my sturdy, lonesome gait
And beware

I will never love a man
Cause love and pain go hand in hand
And I can't do it again

I will never love a man
Cause I could never hurt a man
Not in this new romantic way"

Tell me what do you see, when you're looking at me
On a mission to be, what I'm destined to be
I've done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle it's nothing but love
I'm a soldier a rider a ghetto survivor and all the above
All the above (x7)

[Verse One: Maino]
Listen! Really what do you see, when you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing, see me living my dreams
I've done been through the bottom, I've done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich, heading straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block, look how I rep for the hood
I got nothing but love, now that I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame, money make all of us change
The new Benz is all white, call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me? Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever, that's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built, see the look in my eyes
You take all of this from me, and I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me, but these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets, till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters, mad that I finally done made it
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse Two: Maino]
It's easy to hate, it's harder to love me
Y'all don't understand, y'all quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nike's, picture you living my life
Picture you stuck in the cell, picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge, picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed, picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle, thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle, tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seeing me lately, I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose, this what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father, trying to hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't, I envision Obama
I envision in diamonds, I envision Ferrari's
If the world was perfect, all my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it? Man I'm making a statement
Take a look, and you can tell that I'm destined for greatness


[Hook: T-Pain]

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Now if I'm out on the spot
Or if I'm out on the block
I hustle hard cause it's all the same (They know, they know)
If you know that grind don't stop
Because I rose to the top
And everybody knows my name (Maino, Maino)
Hey! I'm still grinding, still hustling
No more pain, no more suffering
My ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Keep on dancing and shining for love

1999,1000,So Glad to See You,Hot Chip,The Warning,,"So glad to see that you came
Like all birds together we will squawk and we squeak
The joy comes from all our beaks
And ringing bells is our fun
Now our ass is moving as one

If we are forgetting all the rules that we learnt
As all the rule books are burnt
And just as A follows B
Our chorus must always be

So glad to see that you came
We had best times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go home

I have but one true friend
She sings to me in my solitude
And I know her name
I tried to know her, in all her changes
And I don't know her place
And I don't see her face

When we come together then we forget ourselves
And just as night follows day
The beginning must become the end
And so we will start again
When we come together then we meet other souls
And then we make our goodbye
And we lay our bones to rest
As birds we dream of the sky

Please let me go
Please help me go

So glad to see that you came
We had nice times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go home
We had best times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go home

I have but one true friend
She sings to me in my solitude
And I know her name
I tried to know her, in all her changes
And I don't know her place
And I don't see her face

When we come together then we forget ourselves
And just as night follows day
The beginning must become the end
And so we will start again
When we come together then we meet other souls
And then we make our goodbye
And we lay our bones to rest
As birds we dream of the sky

Please let me go
Please help me go

So glad to see that you came
We had nice times
We hope you come again
Please come and see the sea
If you come we'll have best times again
But now it's time to go
Time to go home"
