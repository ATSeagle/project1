Come up to meet you, tell you I'm sorry
You don't know how lovely you are
I had to find you, tell you I need you
Tell you I set you apart
Tell me your secrets, and ask me your questions
Oh, let's go back to the start
Running in circles, coming up tails
Heads on a science apart

Nobody said it was easy
It's such a shame for us to part
Nobody said it was easy
No one ever said it would be this hard
Oh, take me back to the start

I was just guessing at numbers and figures
Pulling the puzzles apart

Running in circles, chasing our tails
Coming back as we are

When you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need

I fell right through the cracks

6,9,How to Save a Life,The Fray,How to Save a Life,"[Verse 1]
Step one, you say we need to talk
He walks, you say ""sit down; it's just a talk""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all, you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
And pray to God He hears you
And pray to God He hears you, and

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness

8,12,Such Great Heights,The Postal Service,Give Up,"[Verse 1]
I am thinking it's a sign
That the freckles in our eyes
Are mirror images
And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned

And I have to speculate
That God himself did make
Us into corresponding shapes
Like puzzle pieces from the clay

[Verse 2]
And true, it may seem like a stretch
But it's thoughts like this that catch
My troubled head when you're away
When I am missing you to death

When you are out there on the road
For several weeks of shows
And when you scan the radio
I hope this song will guide you home

[Chorus]
They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

[Verse 3]
I tried my best to leave
This all on your machine
But the persistent beat
It sounded thin upon listening

And that frankly will not fly
You will hear the shrillest highs
And lowest lows with the windows down
When this is guiding you home

[Chorus]
They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away
""Come down now,"" but we'll stay

They will see us waving from such great heights
""Come down now,"" they'll say
But everything looks perfect from far away

There is no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
No song that I could sing but I can try for your heart
Our dreams and they are made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
With sepia-toned loving

[Verse 2]
Love is the answer
At least for most of the questions in my heart
Like why are we here? And where do we go?
And how come it's so hard?
It's not always easy and
Sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look up at stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

[Verse 3]
And all of these moments
Just might find their way into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings
Or brings new things
For tomorrow night you see
That they'll be gone too

Too many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find their way
Into my day to day scene
I'd be under the impression
I was somewhere in between
With only two
Just me and you
Not so many things we got to do
Or places we got to be
We'll sit beneath the mango tree now

Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, we're somewhere in between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together

I believe in memories
They look so...
So pretty when I sleep
And I wa...
And when I wake up
You look so pretty
Sleeping next to me

Not enough time
And there is no...

And there is no
Combination of words I could say
But I will still
Tell you one thing
We're better together",2005,2000s

I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
What I had to do, had to run from you
I'm in love with you, but the vibe is wrong
And that haunted me, all the way home
So you never know, never never know
Never know enough, 'til it's over love
'Til we lose control, system overload
Screaming, ""No, no, no, n-nooo!""
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I wanna move, but can't escape from you
So I keep it low, keep a secret code
So everybody else don't have to know

Now keep your love lockdown—your love lockdown

I can't keep my cool, so I keep it true
I got something to lose, so I gotta move
I can't keep myself, and still keep you too
So I keep in mind, when I'm on my own
Somewhere far from home, in the danger zone
How many times did I tell you 'fore it finally got through?
You lose, you lose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
See I had to go, see I had to move
No more wasting time, you can't wait for life
We're just racing time, where's the finish line?

I bet no one knew, I got no one new
Know I said I'm through, but got love for you
But I'm not loving you, the way I wanted to
Gotta keep it going, keep the loving going
Keep it on the roll, only God knows
If I be with you, baby I'm confused
You choose, you choose
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to
Where I wanna go, I don't need you
I've been down this road, too many times before
I'm not loving you, way I wanted to

Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of Wonder bread, and went right back to bed
And history books forgot about us and the Bible didn't mention us
And the Bible didn't mention us, not even once

[Chorus]
You are my sweetest downfall
I loved you first, I loved you first
Beneath the stars came falling on our heads
But they're just old light, they're just old light
Your hair was long when we first met

[Verse 2]
Samson came to my bed
Told me that my hair was red
Told me I was beautiful, and came into my bed
Oh, I cut his hair myself one night
A pair of dull scissors in the yellow light
And he told me that I'd done alright
And kissed me 'til the morning light, the morning light
And he kissed me 'til the morning light

[Verse 3]
Samson went back to bed
Not much hair left on his head
He ate a slice of Wonder bread, and went right back to bed
Oh, we couldn't bring the columns down
Yeah, we couldn't destroy a single one
And history books forgot about us
And the Bible didn't mention us, not even once

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

[Verse 2]
If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I'd know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

[Chorus 1]
If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted (Wanted)
'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake
Think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

[Chorus 2]
But you're just a boy
You don't understand
(Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted

You step a little closer each day

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring

[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

What's wrong with the world, mama?
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world's addicted to the drama
Only attracted to the things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we tryin' to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and the Crips, and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate, then you're bound to get irate
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love, this'll set us straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

[Chorus]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us
Send some guidance from above
These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 2: Taboo]
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace is so strong
Then why are there pieces of love that don't belong
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gases fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoing sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself, is the lovin' really gone?
So I can ask myself, really, what is going wrong?
With this world that we livin' in, people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on, but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, and swept under the rug
If you never know truth, then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all? (Come on, I don't know)
And where's the love y'all?

[Chorus]
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Will you practice what you preach?
And would you turn the other cheek?
Father, father, father, help us

These people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love? (love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love)
Where is the love? (the love, the love)

[Verse 3: apl.de.ap]
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm getting older, y'all people gets colder
Most of us only care about money-makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo, whatever happened to the values of humanity?
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality?
Instead of spreadin' love we spreadin' animosity
Lack of understandin' leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
It's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself…

Did I disappoint you or let you down?
Should I be feeling guilty or let the judges frown?
Cause I saw the end before we'd begun
Yes I saw you were blinded and I knew I had won
So I took what's mine by eternal right
Took your soul out into the night
It may be over but it won't stop there
I am here for you, if you'd only care
You touched my heart, you touched my soul
You changed my life and all my goals

My heart was blinded by yours
I've kissed your lips and held your hand
Shared your dreams and shared your bed
I know you well, I know your smell
I've been addicted to you

And span the length of the Isle of Manhattan

Making a lake of the East River and Hudson

If I could open my mouth
Wide enough for a marching band to march out

And bend through alleys and bounce off all the buildings

I wish we could open our eyes
To see in all directions at the same time
Oh what a beautiful view
If you were never aware of what was around you

And it is true what you said
That I live like a hermit in my own head
But when the sun shines again
I'll pull the curtains and blinds to let the light in

That I'm content with loneliness
Because none of it was ever worth the risk

I'd better learn to accept that
There are things in my life that I can't control

[Verse 1]
They say love ain't nothing but a sore
I don't even know what love is
Too many tears have had to fall
Don't you know I'm so tired of it all
I have known terror dizzy spells
Finding out the secrets words won't tell
Whatever it is it can't be named
There's a part of my world that's fading away
You know I don't want to be clever
To be brilliant or superior
True like ice, true like fire
Now I know that a breeze can blow me away
Now I know there's much more dignity
In defeat than in the brightest victory

If happiness came I miss the call
The stormy days ain't over

Cause the chase is all you know and she stopped running months ago

The flames and smoke climbed out of every window
And disappeared with everything that you held dear
But you shed not a single tear
For the things that you didn't need
Cause you knew you were finally free

Cause all you see is where else you could be when you're at home

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself

I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

The script, it called for rain, but it was clear that day
So we faked it
The marker snapped and I yelled ""quiet on the set""
And then called ""action!"" (And then called ""action!"")

But not our last days of silence, screaming, blurred
Most of what I remember makes me sure
I should have stopped you from walking out the door

Is a tiny prayer to father time

And I rationed my breaths as I said to myself
That I'd already taken too much today
As each descending peak on the LCD
Took you a little farther away from me
Away from me

Amongst the vending machines and year-old​ magazines
In a place where we only say goodbye
It stung like a violent wind that our memories depend
On a faulty camera in our minds
And I knew that you were truth I would rather lose
Than to have never lain beside at all
And I looked around at all the eyes on the ground
As the TV entertained itself

'Cause there's no comfort in the waiting room
Just nervous paces bracing for bad news
And then the nurse comes round and everyone lifts their head
But I'm thinking of what Sarah said:

And I'm screaming at the top of my lungs
Pretending the echoes belong to someone

Silhouettes when our bodies finally go

I wanted to walk through the empty streets
And feel something constant under my feet
But all the news reports recommended that I stay indoors
Because the air outside will make

Until our shells simply cannot hold all our insides in
And that's when we'll explode
And it won't be a pretty sight

No longer easy on the eyes but these wrinkles masterfully disguise
The youthful boy below
Who turned your way and saw something he was not looking for
Both a beginning and an end
But now he lives inside someone he does not recognize when he catches his reflection on accident

On the back of a motorbike with your arms outstretched trying to take flight, leaving everything behind
But even at our swiftest speed we couldn't break from the concrete
In the city where we still reside
And I have learned that even landlocked lovers yearn
For the sea like navy men
Cause now we say goodnight from our own separate sides
Like brothers on a hotel bed

It was some time in early September
Though you were lazy about it, you made me wait around
I was so crazy about you I didn't mind

So I was late for class, I locked my bike to yours
It wasn't hard to find, you painted flowers on it
I guess that I was afraid that if you rolled away
You might not roll back my direction real soon

Well I was crazy about you then and now
The craziest thing of all is over ten years have gone by
And you're still mine, we're locked in time
Let's Rewind

Do you remember when we first moved in together?
The piano took up the living room
You played me boogie-woogie I played you love songs
You'd say we're playing house now you still say we are

We built our getaway up in a tree we found
We felt so far away but we were still in town
Now I remember watching that old tree burn down
I took a picture that I don't like to look at

Well all these times they come and go
And alone don't seem so long
Over ten years have gone by
We can't rewind, we're locked in time

Two words I always think
After you're gone
When I realize, I was acting all wrong

So selfish
Two words that could describe
Oh, actions of mine
When patience is in short supply

We don't need to say goodbye
We don't need to fight and cry
Oh, we, we could
Hold each other tight, tonight

We're so helpless
We're slaves to our impulses
We're afraid of our emotions
And no one knows where the shore is
We're divided by the oceans
And the only thing I know is
That the answer isn't for us
No, the answer isn't for us

I'm sorry
Two words I always think
Oh, after you're gone
When I realize I was acting all wrong

On “strictly business,” as he said to the Mrs

And formed the bruises
That you said you didn't want to fade

This is the closest thing to crazy I have ever been
Feeling twenty-two, acting seventeen
This is the nearest thing to crazy I have ever known
I was never crazy on my own
And now I know that there's a link between the two
Being close to craziness and being close to you

How can you make me fall apart
Then break my fall with loving lies?

It's so easy to close your eyes

How can anyone feel so blue?

188,23,Photobooth,Death Cab for Cutie,The Forbidden Love E.P.,"I remember when the days were long
And the nights when the living room was on the lawn
Constant quarreling, the childish fits
And our clothes in a pile on the ottoman
All the slander and double-speak
Were only foolish attempts to show you did not mean
Anything but the blatant proof
Was your lips touching mine in the photobooth

And as the summer's ending
The cool air will push your hard heart away
You were so condescending
And this is all that's left
Scraping paper to document
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on

Cup your mouth to compress the sound
Skinny dipping with the kids from a nearby town
And everything that I said was true
As the flashes blinded us in the photobooth
Well, I lost track, and then those words were said
You took the wheel and you steered us into my bed
And soon we woke and I walked you home
And it was pretty clear that it was hardly love

And as the summer's ending
The cool air will rush your hard heart away
You were so condescending
And this is all that's left
Scraping paper to document
I've packed a change of clothes and it's time to move on

And as the summer's ending
The cool air will rush your hard heart away
You were so condescending
As the alcohol drained the days

And as the summer’s ending
The cool air will rush you hard heart away
You were so condescending
And this is all that’s left
The empty bottles, spent cigarettes
So pack a change of clothes cause it’s time to move on",2000,2000s

So why d'you have to lie?

Do you fall upon your knees?
And do you sit within your picture?
Do you still forget the breeze?

And she may wisely cling to the ground

Into nostalgia's palm and feed on the traces

But where are the still unborn who could look at me with the one eye
Who could look at me with no eyes
Who could look at me with me in their eyes

What's graying? What's aging anyway? It's not growing in the wild

When you look at me with your black eyes
When you look at me with your dead eyes

When the tales of brothers Grimm and Gorey
Have been outlawed

You don't want to start over

Take your places now

Well, me and my lady had our first big fight
So I drove around till I saw the neon light
A corner bar, and it just seemed right
So I pulled up

[Verse 2]
Not a soul around but the old bar keep
Down at the end and looking half asleep
And he walked up, and said: ""What'll it be?""
I said: ""The good stuff""

[Verse 3]
He didn't reach around for the whiskey;
He didn't pour me a beer
His blue eyes kind of went misty
He said: ""You can't find that here

[Chorus 1]
Because it's the first long kiss on a second date
Momma's all worried when you get home late
And dropping the ring in the spaghetti plate
Because your hands are shaking so much
And it's the way that she looks with the rice in her hair
Eating burnt suppers the whole first year
And asking for seconds to keep her from tearing up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

[Verse 4]
He grabbed a carton of milk and he poured a glass
And I smiled and said: ""I'll have some of that""
We sat there and talked as an hour passed
Like old friends

[Verse 5]
I saw a black and white picture and it caught my stare
It was a pretty girl with bouffant hair
He said: ""That's my Bonnie
Taken about a year after we were wed""

[Verse 6]
He said ""Spent five years in the bottle
When the cancer took her from me
But I've been sober three years now
Because the one thing stronger than the whiskey

[Chorus 2]
Was the sight of her holding my baby girl
The way she adored that string of pearls
I gave her the day that our youngest boy, Earl
Married his high school love
And it's a new tee-shirt saying: 'I'm a Grandpa'
Being right there as our time got small
And holding her hand, when the Good Lord called her up
Yeah, man, that's the good stuff""

[Outro]
He said: ""When you get home, she'll start to cry
When she says: 'I'm sorry,' say: 'So am I'
And look into those eyes, so deep in love
And drink it up

That's the good stuff""",2002,2000s

Insect noise is all that I hear
A magic trick makes the world disappear
The skies are dark, they're dark but they're clear

A distant motorcade and suddenly there's joy
The snow and tickertape blurs all my senses numb
It's like the finish line where everything just ends
The crack of radios seems close enough to touch

Cold water, cleaning my wounds
A side parade, with a single balloon
I'm done with this, I'm counting to ten
Blue as seas, running to them

I feel like I am watching everything from space
And in a minute I hear my name and I wake
I think the finish line's a good place we could start

Already are
Drawing deep breaths past my door
And last night's phrases
Sick with lack of basis
Are still writhing on my floor

[Hook 1]
And it doesn't seem fair
That your wicked words should work in holding me down
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information
Given at close range
For the gag and the bind
And the ammunition round

Conversation, once colored by esteem
Became dialogue
As a diagram of a play for blood
- Took a vacation; my palate got clean
Now I can taste your agenda
While you're spitting your cud

I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information
Given at close range
For the gag and the bind
And the ammunition round

Cause I am not in love

""What is this posture I have to stare at""
- That's what he said
When I was sitting up straight
Changed the name of the game cause he lost it
He knew he was wrong
But he knew it too late
But I'm not being fair
Cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth
But I'd like to choose right
Take all the things
That I said
That he stole
Put 'em in a sack
Swing 'em over my shoulder
Turn on my heels, step out of his sight
Try to live in a lovelier light

Nothing shines quite as bright

It's not mine, but I want it so

Without you I'll be miserable at best

In every single way

Down to the river where they caught a wild alligator

Civil war skeletons in their graves
They came up clapping in the spirit of the aviator

But Abraham Lincoln was the great emancipator

And wanted to see if you were checking in on your medication

Take care, honey

See ya. Bye bye”)

I have to block out thoughts of you so I don’t lose my head

Dropping little reels of tape to remind me that I’m alone
Playing movies in my head that make a porno feel like home
There's a burning in my pride, a nervous bleeding in my brain
An ounce of peace is all I want for you; will you never call again?
And will you never say that you loved me just to put it in my face?
And will you never try to reach me?

While I was busy waging wars on myself, you were trying to stop the fight
You never doubted my warped opinions on things like suicidal hate
You made me compliment myself when it was way too hard to take

Kicking shadows on the street for every mistake that I had made

And then I fell down yelling, “Make it go away!”
Just make a smile come back and shine just like it used to be

Says 'I hate people like you'

Bringing with the true love his unholy friend

(One, two, three)

[Verse 1]
You've been alone
You've been afraid
I've been a fool in so many ways
But I would change my life if you thought you might try to love me
So please give me another chance to write you another song And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

[Verse 2]
I'm not a saint
I'm just a man who had heaven and Earth in the palm of his hand
But I threw it away
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness
And if you could just please give me another chance to write you another song
And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

[Verse 3]
Little girl, you're all I've got
Don't you leave me standing here once again
'Cause I'll give you my life
Yes, I would, if you would let me try to love you
So please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again

I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2am and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane

And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will

Talks business with my father

There's a big ol' lump that can't hide, c'mon
Here they go again, wearing disguises as your best friend

Blam-ba-blam, blam-ba-blam, hey hey

You should tell 'em clear the way
And tell 'em to step back, back-ba-back, hey hey

Don't you wonder why you always end up in last? Uh
(Beautiful losers!)
Well I would bet you anything that it's karma from your past, c'mon
Wake up little boy, there's no spaceship here employed
They zapped that shit away, like
Damn-da-damn, damn-da-damn, hey hey
You're impoverished at your knees
But you gotta stand up and face the fees
And that's when you say, give the shoulder a
Dap-ta-dap, dap-ta-dap, hey hey

Watch them bullets ricochet like
Blam-ba-blam, blam blam, ba-blam-blam, a kill joy

Are you still on the stoop
Watching the windows close?
I've not seen you lately
On the street, by the beach
Or places we used to go

I've a picture of you
On our favorite day by the seaside
There's a bird stealing bread
That I brought out from under my nose

Tell me baby, tell me
Does his company make
Light of a rainy day?
How I've missed you lately
And the way we would speak
And all that we wouldn't say

Do his hands in your hair
Feel a lot like a thing you believe in
Or a bit like a bird stealing bread
Out from under your nose

Tell me baby tell me
Do you carry the words
Around like a key or change?
I've been thinking lately
Of a night on the stoop
And all that we wouldn't say

If I see you again
On the street, by the beach
In the evening
Will you fly like a bird stealing bread
Out from under my nose?",2002,2000s

Please, remember me happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin, the time when
We counted every black car passing
Your house beneath the hill
And up until someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention

[Verse 2]
But please, remember me fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say
That the pearly gates
Had some eloquent graffiti
Like ""We'll meet again"" and ""Fuck the man""
And ""Tell my mother not to worry""
And angels with their great handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry

[Verse 3]
And please, remember me that Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white
By midnight, we'd forgotten one another
And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city

[Verse 4]
So please, remember me mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Calling passers-by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour
Gleam and resonate, just like the gates
Around the holy kingdom
With words like ""Lost and found"" and ""Don't look down""
And ""Someone save temptation""

[Verse 5]
And please, remember me as in the dream
We had as rug-burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies
That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior

[Verse 6]
But please, remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above their running
In circles around the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright, on cinder gray, in spray paint
""Who the hell can see forever?""

[Verse 7]
And please, remember me seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turned from me
And said, ""The trapeze act was wonderful
But never meant to last"", the clown that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger

[Verse 8]
So please, remember me finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the pearly gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing
Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissing on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around a frightened trapeze swinger",2009,2000s

Happy hands and your elbow
In the appropriate place

And we ignored our others
Happy plans, for that delicate look
Upon your face

Our bodies moved and hardened
Hurting parts of your garden
With no room for a pardon
In a place where no one knows
What we have done

Do you come
Together ever with him?
And is he dark enough
Enough to see your light?
And do you brush your teeth before you kiss?
Do you miss my smell?
And is he bold enough to take you on?
Do you feel like you belong?
And does he drive you wild?
Or just mildly free?
What about me?

Well, you held me like a lover
Sweaty hands, and my foot
In the appropriate place

And we use cushions to cover
Happy glands in the mild issue
Of our disgrace

Our minds pressed and guarded
While our flesh disregarded
The lack of space for the light-hearted
In the boom that beats our drum

I know I make you cry
And I know sometimes you wanna die
But do you really feel alive without me?
If so, be free
If not, leave him for me
Before one of us has
Accidental babies
For we are in love

Enough to see your light

The glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us
As love sweeps over the room
Because we tend to make
Each other blush

So keep your chest in the game
And drop your jaw and coax me

And thankin' God that you weren't here

Is a letter that you never read

And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

[Verse 1]
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe, that the pictures are all I can feel

[Verse 2]
Remembering you
Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you
Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go

[Verse 3]
Remembering you
Fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you
How you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything

[Bridge]
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you

[Verse 4]
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you

[Outro]
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you",1989,80s

What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun

In a blink of an eye and be gone from me

Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me

Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move

All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With the one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun

And I say, ""Yes, you look wonderful tonight""

We go to a party and everyone turns to see
This beautiful lady that's walking around with me
And then she asks me ""Do you feel all right?""

The love light in your eyes

Is that you just don't realize how much I love you

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 1: Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
Me, she fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game, but you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?

Summer after high school, when we first met
We'd make out in your Mustang to Radiohead
And on my 18th birthday, we got matching tattoos
Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof
Talk about our future like we had a clue
Never planned that one day I'd be losing you

We'd keep all our promises, be us against the world
In another life, I would make you stay

I was June, and you were my Johnny Cash
Never one without the other, we made a pact
Sometimes when I miss you, I put those records on, whoa
Someone said you had your tattoo removed
Saw you downtown, singing the blues
It's time to face the music, I'm no longer your muse

The only girl I've ever loved
Was born with roses in her eyes
But then they buried her alive
One evening, 1945
With just her sister at her side
And only weeks before the guns
All came and rained on everyone
Now she's a little boy in Spain
Playing pianos filled with flames
On empty rings around the sun
All sing to say my dream has come

But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

And now we ride the circus wheel
With your dark brother wrapped in white
Says it was good to be alive
But now he rides a comet's flame
And won't be coming back again
The Earth looks better from a star
That's right above from where you are
He didn't mean to make you cry
With sparks that ring and bullets fly
On empty rings around your heart
The world just screams and falls apart

But now we must pick up every piece
Of the life we used to love
Just to keep ourselves
At least enough to carry on

And here's where your mother sleeps
And here is the room where your brothers were born

Where their bodies once moved but don't move anymore

All when I'd want to keep white roses in their eyes",1998,90s

When I was 13, I had my first love
There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

Love hurts, love scars, love wounds
And marks, any heart
Not tough or strong enough
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain
Love is like a cloud
Holds a lot of rain
Love hurts, ooh, ooh love hurts

I know a thing or two
I learned from you
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot
Love is like a flame
It burns you when it's hot
Love hurts, ooh, ooh love hurts

Some fools think of happiness
Blissfulness, togetherness
Some fools fool themselves I guess
They're not foolin' me

[Verse 1: Macklemore]
When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay
‘Cause I could draw, my uncle was, and I kept my room straight
I told my mom, tears rushing down my face
She's like, ""Ben, you've loved girls since before Pre-K!""
Trippin', yeah I guess she had a point, didn't she?
A bunch of stereotypes all in my head
I remember doing the math like, ""Yeah, I'm good at little league.""
A pre-conceived idea of what it all meant
For those that like the same sex had the characteristics
The right-wing conservatives think it's a decision
And you can be cured with some treatment and religion
Man-made, rewiring of a pre-disposition
Playing God, aw nah, here we go
America the brave still fears what we don't know
And ""God loves all his children"" is somehow forgotten
But we paraphrase a book written thirty-five hundred years ago
I don't know

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to
My love, my love, my love
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 2: Macklemore]
If I was gay, I would think hip-hop hates me
Have you read the YouTube comments lately?
""Man, that's gay"" gets dropped on the daily
We've become so numb to what we're sayin'
Our culture founded from oppression
Yet we don't have acceptance for 'em
Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board
A word rooted in hate, yet our genre still ignores it
""Gay"" is synonymous with the lesser
It's the same hate that's caused wars from religion
Gender to skin color, the complexion of your pigment
The same fight that led people to walk-outs and sit-ins
It's human rights for everybody, there is no difference
Live on and be yourself
When I was at church they taught me something else
If you preach hate at the service, those words aren't anointed
That holy water that you soak in has been poisoned
When everyone else is more comfortable remaining voiceless
Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen
I might not be the same, but that's not important
No freedom 'til we're equal, damn right I support it

[Trombone Interlude]

[Hook: Mary Lambert]
And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to

She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm
She keeps me warm

[Verse 3: Macklemore]
We press play, don't press pause: progress, march on!
With a veil over our eyes, we turn our back on the cause
'Til the day that my uncles can be united by law
Kids are walking 'round the hallway
Plagued by a pain in their heart
A world so hateful, some would rather die than be who they are
And a certificate on paper isn't gonna solve it all
But it's a damn good place to start
No law's gonna change us, we have to change us
Whatever god you believe in, we come from the same one
Strip away the fear, underneath it's all the same love
About time that we raised up!

And I can't change, even if I tried
Even if I wanted to

I still can't turn away
With all the dreams you never thought you'd lose
Tossed along the way
Letters that you never meant to send
Get lost or thrown away

That never knew their names
We don't belong to no one

You could hide beside me
Maybe for a while
And I won't tell no one your name
And I won't tell 'em your name

Scars are souvenirs you never lose
The past is never far
Did you lose yourself somewhere out there?
Did you get to be a star?
And don't it make you sad to know that life
Is more than who we are?

You grew up way too fast
And now there's nothing to believe
And reruns all become our history

Quite half as much as I know I need her
I wonder why there's not another guy that she'd prefer

And when I feel like giving up, like my world is falling down
I show up at 3 A.M., she's still up watching Vacation

Makes my pulse react
That it's only the thrill of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract
It's physical
Only logical
You must try to ignore that it means more than that

Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken?

It may seem to you that I'm acting confused
When you're close to me
If I tend to look dazed I've read it someplace

There's a phrase that fits
But whatever the reason you do it for me

What's love but a second-hand emotion?
What's love got to do, got to do with it?

If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Somebody
Told me that this planet was small, we used to live in
The same building, on the same floor, and never met before
Until I'm overseas on tour, and peeped this Ethiopian
Queen from Philly taking classes abroad
She studying film and photo, flash, focus, record
Said she working on a flick and could my clique do the score
She said she loved my show in Paris at Elysee Montmartre
And that I stepped off the stage and took a piece of her heart
We knew from the start that things fall apart and tend to shatter
She like, ""That shit don't matter."" When I get home, get at her
Through letter, phone, whatever; let's link, let's get together
Shit, you think not, think the Thought went home and forgot?
Time passed, we back in Philly, now she up in my spot
Telling me the things I'm telling her is making her hot
Starting building with her constantly round-the-clock
Now she in my world like hip-hop, and keep telling me…

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 2: Black Thought + Eve]
Yo, I'm the type that's always catching a flight
And sometimes I gotta be out at the height of the night
And that's when she flip and get on some old…  another lonely night
Seem like I'm on the side, you only loving your mic
I know you gotta get that paper, daddy, keep that shit tight
But, yo, I need some sort of love in my life, you dig me?
While politicking with my sister from New York City
She said she know this ball player and he think I'm pretty—psych
I'm playin', boo, you know it's just with you I'm staying, boo
And when cats be poppin' game, I don't hear what they sayin', boo
When you out there in the world, I'm still your girl
With all my classes I don't have the time for life's thrills
So when you sweating on stage, think of me when you rhyme
And don't be listening to your homies, they be leadin' you blind
Yeah, so what you saying, I can trust you? Is you crazy?! You my king for real
But sometimes relationships get ill, no doubt

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
That snake could be that chick and that rat could be that cool cat
That's whispering, ""She trying to play you for the fool, Black.""
If something's on your chest, then let it be known
See, I'm not your every five minutes all on the phone
And on the topic of trust, it's just a matter of fact
That people bite back and fracture what's intact
And they'll forever be, I ain't on some ""Oh, I'm a celebrity!""
I deal with the real, so if it's artificial, let it be
I've seen people caught in love like whirlwinds
Listening to their squads and listening to girlfriends
That's exactly the point where their whole world ends
Lies come in, that's where that drama begins, and she like…

[Chorus: Erykah Badu]
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where
I been or who I saw or
What club I went to with my homies
Baby, don't worry, you know that you got me
If you were worried 'bout where

What club I went to with my homies

Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On the carousel, so around I spun
With no directions, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none

[Pre-Chorus 1: B.o.B]
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know (That you wanna know)
But never mind that, we should let it go (We should let it go)

Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven

Visit every month like I'm split life living

To cast divine arrows into her soul
To grab her attention swift and quick
Or morrow the marrow of her bones be thick
With turpentine kisses and mistaken blows

See the Devil may do as the Devil may care
He loves none sweeter as sweeter the dare
Her mouth the mischief he doth seek
Her heart the captive of which he speaks
So note all ye lovers in love with the sound
Your world be shattered with nary a note
Of one Cupid's arrow under your coat

The metal vibrates underneath your fingers

Who are we to play with hearts and throw away it all?
Oh, who are we to turn each other's heads?
Who are we to find ourselves in other people's beds?

You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive, but too cool to care
You stood in my doorway with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

[Pre-Chorus]
Well in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees

These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You're always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art
Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar
You'd teach me of honest things
Things that were daring, things that were clean
Things that knew what an honest dollar did mean
I hid my soiled hands behind my back
Somewhere along the line, I must've got
Off track with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Excuse me
Think I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself

And it being late, you'd like some company

You put the good times into my fun

We've tried the goodbyes
So many days
We walk in the same direction
So that we could never stray
They say if you love somebody
Then you have got to set them free
But I would rather be locked to you than live in this pain and misery

They say that time, will make all this go away
But it's time that has taken my tomorrows and turned them into yesterdays
And once again that rising sun is a droppin on down
And once again you my friend are no where to be found

And it's so hard to do and so easy to say

So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I'd go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

[Post-Chorus]
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

Oh but I know love as a fading thing
Just fickle as a feather in a stream
See honey, I saw love, you see it came to me
It put its face up to my face so I could see
Yeah, then I saw love disfigure me
Into something I am not recognizing

You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’
I will not open myself up this way again
I lay my face to the soil, and all my teeth to the sand
I will not lay like this for days now upon end
You will not see me fall, or see me struggle to stand
To be acknowledged by some touch from his gnarled hand
You see the cage it called; I said ‘come on in’
I will not open myself up this way again

You see the moon is bright in that treetop night
I see the shadows that we cast in the cold clean light
Now my feet are gold, and my heart is white
And we race out on the desert plains all night
See honey, I am not some broken thing
I do not lay here in the dark waiting for thee
No my heart is gold and my feet are light
And I am racing out on the desert plains all night

Some say love is a burning thing, that it makes a fiery ring
Oh but I know love as a caging thing
Just a killer, come to call from some awful dream
Ah and all you folks, you come to see
You just stand there in the glass looking at me
But my heart is wild and my bones are steam
And I could kill you with my bare hands if I was free",2013,2010s

At least I'd lose this sense of sensing
Something else that hides away
From me and you, there are worlds to part
With aching looks and breaking hearts
And all the prayers your hands can make
Oh, I just take as much as you can throw
And then throw it all away
Oh I'll throw it all away
Like throwing faces at the sky
Like throwing arms round yesterday
I stood and stared
Wide-eyed in front of you
And the face I saw looked back the way I wanted to
But I just can't hold my tears away the way you do
Elise, believe I never wanted this
I thought this time I'd keep all of my promises
I thought you were the girl I always dreamed about
But I let the dream go
And the promises broke and make-believe ran out

[Chorus]
So, Elise it doesn't matter what you say
I just can't stay here every yesterday
Like keep on acting out the same
The way we act out
Every way to smile, forget
And make-believe we never needed
Any more than this
Any more than this

And every time I try to pick it up
Like falling sand
As fast as I pick it up
It runs away through my clutching hands

And I could be wrong
Maybe I've been hoping too hard
But I've gone this far
And it's more than I hoped for

Maybe I'll be sorry when you're gone
I'll take my chances
I forgot how nice romance is
I haven't been there for the longest time

I had second thoughts at the start
I said to myself, ""hold on to your heart""
Now I know the woman that you are
You're wonderful so far

755,995,Goodbye Kiss,Kasabian,Velociraptor!,"[Verse 1]
Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss
I'd broke my wrist

It all kicked off
I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind
'Cos love's hard to find

[Hook]
La la la la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence far too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs

[Chorus]
Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we will meet again

[Verse 2]
Running wild
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
'Cos we burnt out, that's what you do
When you have everything, it can't be true

[Hook]
La la la la
Maybe the days we had are gone
Living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
The last stand
Let go of my hand

[Chorus]
Turning slowly
Looking back, see
No words can save this
You're broken and I'm pissed
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we will meet again

You go your way and
I'll go my way
No words can save us
This lifestyle made us
Run along
Like I'm supposed to
Be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope some day that we can meet again",2012,2010s

Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now

[Chorus]
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one",2014,2010s

I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

[Hook]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

[Verse 2]
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets

[Hook]
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

[Verse 3]
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I’ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up",2011,2010s

I can not live
Peacefully without you
For even a moment
I miss you terribly
When you're away

He's away
This ain't right
I'm alone
I'm taking an aeroplane
Across the world
To follow my heart

How come out of all the people in the world
Only one can make me complete?
One word, one word on the phone
Makes me happy
One touch, but one touch directly
Makes me ecstatic

I'm taking an aeroplane
Across the world
To follow my heart",1993,90s

Love, I get so lost sometimes
Days pass and this emptiness fills my heart
When I want to run away, I drive off in my car
But whichever way I go, I come back to the place you are

Just a few minutes more
Gonna get that old feeling
When you walk through that door

Starry, starry night

Look out on a summer's day
With eyes that know the darkness in my soul
Shadows on the hills
Sketch the trees and the daffodils
Catch the breeze and the winter chills
In colors on the snowy linen land

And how you tried to set them free

Perhaps they'll listen now

Flaming flowers that brightly blaze
Swirling clouds in violet haze
Reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue
Colors changing hue
Morning fields of amber grain
Weathered faces lined in pain
Are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand

Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity
And how you tried to set them free
They would not listen, they did not know how
Perhaps they'll listen now

For they could not love you
But still your love was true
And when no hope was left in sight
On that starry, starry night
You took your life, as lovers often do
But I could have told you, Vincent
This world was never meant for one
As beautiful as you

[Verse 3]
Starry, starry night
Portraits hung in empty halls
Frameless heads on nameless walls
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget
Like the strangers that you've met
The ragged men in ragged clothes
The silver thorn; a bloody rose
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

I would say I'm doing just fine
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind

And I thought you were innocent
Took this heart and put it through hell

Ooh, when I met you
I just knew that you would take my heart and run
Until you told me how you loved for me, you said I’m not the one
So I slowly came to see all of the things that you were made of
And now I hope my dreams and inspiration lead me towards a real love

I would love you more than life
If you'll come and be my wife

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in
Lift me like an olive branch and be my homeward dove
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Oh let me see your beauty when the witnesses are gone
Let me feel you moving like they do in Babylon
Show me slowly what I only know the limits of
Oh dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the wedding now, oh dance me on and on
Dance me very tenderly and dance me very long
We're both of us beneath our love, we're both of us above
Dance me to the end of love
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to the children who are asking to be born
Dance me through the curtains that our kisses have outworn
Raise a tent of shelter now, though every thread is torn
Dance me to the end of love

Dance me to your beauty with a burning violin
Dance me through the panic 'til I'm gathered safely in

Here we go
Welcome to my funeral
Without you, I don't even have a pulse

Double life

Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone, it's a lonelier place

The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes and the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall but I give you it all

To get you into my world and hold you within

In love there is no measure of time

That you and I live in each other's heart
We may be oceans away

I was anxious
It's better just to stay in bed
Didn't want to fail myself again

Running through all the options
And the endings
Were rolling out in front of me
But I couldn't choose a thread to begin

And I could not love
Cause I could not love myself
Never good enough, no
That was all I'd tell myself
And I was not well
But I could not help myself
I was giving up on living

In the morning
You were leaving
Travelling south again
And you said you were not unprepared

And all the dead ends
And disappointments
Were fading from your memory
Ready for that lonely life to end

And you gave me love
When I could not love myself
And you made me turn
From the way I saw myself
And you're patient, love
And you help me help myself
And you save me
And you save me

Why don't we take off alone
Take a trip somewhere far, far away
We'll be together, all alone again
Like we used to in the early days
Well, well, well darling

[Pre-Chorus]
It's been so long since we took the time
No-one is to blame
I know time flies so quickly
But when I see you darling
It's like we both are falling in love again
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

[Chorus]
Everyday we used to make it love
Why can't we be making love nice and easy
It's time to spread our wings and fly
Don't let another day go by my love
It'll be just like starting over - starting over

Our life together is so precious together
We have grown - we have grown
Although our love is still special
Let's take our chance and fly away somewhere...

There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home

2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey""
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

884,405,Brand New Day,Sting,Brand New Day,"[Verse 1]
How many of you people out there
Been hurt in some kind of love affair
And how many times do you swear that you'll never love again?
How many lonely, sleepless nights
How many lies, how many fights
And why would you want to put yourself through all that again?
""Love is pain,"" I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost?
You never want to feel so sad and lost again
One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile that you've been thinking of all day

[Chorus 1]
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way
Turn the clock to zero, sister
You'll never know how much I missed her
Starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across
Started up a brand new day

[Verse 2]
It could happen to you - just like it happened to me
There's simply no immunity - there's no guarantee
I say love's such a force - if you find yourself in it
And sometimes no reflection is there
Baby wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Wait a minute, wait a minute

[Chorus 2]
You can turn the clock to zero, honey
I’ll sell the stock, we’ll spend all the money
We’re starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock to zero, Mac
I begging her to take me back
I’m thinking in a brand new way

You’re the flame and I’m the candle

What I could not before

For at least I deserve the respect of a kiss goodbye

Frozen hearts growing colder with time
There's no heat from our mouths
Please take me back to when I was yours

And we were in flames, I needed, I needed you
To run through my veins, like disease, disease
And now we are strange, strangers

(I need you... I need you...)

It's different now, gray faced, eyes burnt out
Flames are gone, my gloves are out
I have a feeling love's gone mad

We're too similar, losing our minds
With cabin fever, shut in confined spaces
Lost in the dark, my heart taken and resting on your heart

And we were in flames, I needed, I needed you
To run through my veins, like disease, disease
And now we are strange, strangers

Wait for me to degrade before
You go killing prey for waste of
Daylight speaks when
Slumber's keeping under the bed
Out of revenge, I'm derailing
My youth has stained our sheets
With some piece of me
With some piece of me

Oh, winter crush all of the things that I once loved

Move anti
Focus when I vocalise
Countdown when seek beats
The weak know to hide
I can't choose days to show my pride

So it’s fist in the air, when I hold the mic
Rather be the outkast or the prototype
Can't conform to the filters & pose for hype
They teeth from top charts thats an overbite, Like

…Too many celebrities overnight
Insta careers, over in a moments sight
Gassed from number but your followers move like poltergeist
Pointless pursuing images if your soul ain't right

I can't mix with those energies there
Leviate clear from an enemies stare
Next year I’ll be a better me swear
But I'm here with truth I could never be dare

Cause I , level the vessel in me
Boil like kettles, from instrumentals
Little me never picked pettles
But patterned the rules, to rebel

Revel being the bomb
With Jäger & Red Bull
Technique is immortal
But still I never dance with the devil

Dependable on other man writing

Defeated book a pedicure

Where’s the credentials?

No CV like you're not a Cov residential
Even if I didn’t live in B23
The corrupt still don’t want you to be too free

See the downfall is locked to your mental
I can’t support all the violence they fed you
Can’t support all the standards that tempt you
Never attempted to fit in, just spin riddims to vent to

Cut ties with questioning when
Make moves, not wise to enter the den
Enter with dragons, flagging fire prepared to offended
With a heart full of anger, But mindful of zen

If you can’t take the cold adapt your system (x4)

Hear the sirens, hear the sirens

[Verse 1]
Hear the sirens, hear the circus so profound
I hear the sirens more and more in this here town
Let me catch my breath to breathe then reach across the bed
Just to know we’re safe, I am a grateful man
The slightest bit of light and I can see you clear

[Chorus 1]
Oh, had to take your hand, and feel your breath
For fear this someday will be over
I pull you close, so much to lose
Knowing that nothing lasts forever
I didn’t care, before you were here
I danced in laughter, with the ever after
But all things change, let this remain

[Verse 2]
Hear the sirens covering distance in the night
The sound echoing closer, will they come for me next time?
For every choice, mistake I made it's not my plan
To send you in the arms of another man
And if you choose to stay, I’ll wait, I’ll understand

[Chorus 2]
Oh, it’s a fragile thing, this life we lead
If I think too much, I can get over-
Whelmed by the grace, by which we live our lives
With death over our shoulders
Want you to know, that should I go
I always loved you, held you high above too
I studied your face, the fear goes away

Seen before, or will again

Where we used to go
They seem so quiet now

And I don't know how
To follow you

What's up? Been a minute since we kicked it
You've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you? What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me, I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us

Darling you, you give but you cannot take love

Talking 'bout everything under the moon
With the smell of honeysuckle and your perfume

Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
When you smiled and said to me

Are we gonna do this or what?
I think you know I like you a lot

Bought a wedding band and I got down on one knee

Thinking hopes and lots of dreams that aren't there?
Is it wicked not to care when you've wasted many hours
Talking endlessly to anyone that's there?

I know the truth awaits me
But still I hesitate because of fear

Skipping tickets, making rhymes
Is that all that you believe in?
Wearing rags to make you pretty by design
Rusting armor for effect
Its not fun to watch the rust grow
For it will all be over when you're dead

Counting acts and clutching thoughts
By the river where the moss grows
Over rocks the water running all the time
Is it wicked when you smile even though you feel like crying
Even though you could be sick at any time?

Would you love me as an equal?
Would you love me till I'm dead?

We danced so close
We danced so slow
And I swore I'd never let you go
Together - forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

I guess you'd say we used to talk
About busting out
We'd break their hearts
Together - forever

Never say goodbye, never say goodbye
You and me and my old friends
Hoping it would never end
Say goodbye, never say goodbye
Holdin' on - we got to try
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

EXT. WINTER RIVER, CONNECTICUT - DAY

A crisp and perfect New England town.  Almost too neat
to be real.  No visible townspeople.  CAMERA EXPLORES
town.


CAMERA FLIES

over a rickety bridge -- PAST the Maitland Hardware and
Appliance store -- PAST the church -- the Historical
Society -- UP over the graveyard on the hill and
finally --

To the Maitland house.  The perfect Victorian house
surveying the tiny village.  Suddenly --


A GIANT DADDY LONGLEGS SPIDER

mounts the crest of the hill beside the house, pauses to
wave a spindly leg and then creeps menacingly on top of
the Maitland house.

ADAM (O.S..)
Well, well, you're a big fella...!

A hand -- as big as God's -- with a huge tweezer,
gently reaches down out of the sky and lies, palm up,
in the yard next to the house.  Daddy Longlegs climbs
into it.  The hand rises into the sky again.


INT. ATTIC - NEW ANGLE - DAY

Reveals Winter River as a miniature town, while The
Daddy Longlegs and the hand are normal size.  Above the
model are a homely representation of moon, sun, and
stars -- a whole, tiny, mechanical universe to track
the hours of the day.  A large plat map of the city is
prominent on the wall.

The hand is ADAM MAITLAND'S.  In his late 30's, he's a
solid easy-going citizen.  Capra used to make movies
about him.

Adam's model town sprawls across most of the attic
space.  Windows on either end of the attic shed good
light into the warm room.  Adam very carefully lifts
the spider out the open window.  Smiles as he drips him
lightly on the breeze.


CAMERA TILTS UP FROM THE WINDOW

To see the real Winter River, laid out exactly as the
model, at the foot of the hill.  Adam breathes deeply
and looks very pleased at the glorious town below him.


ON HIS HUGE HAND AGAIN

as it reaches into model and tweezes a tiny sign into
the tiny window of Maitland's Hardware Store on main
street.  It reads:

ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND
ARE
ON VACATION!
HOORAY!

Adam leans down and eyes the sign.

BARBARA
(behind him)
I'm ready!

Adam turns to see entering:  BARBARA MAITLAND, 35 -- a
wholesome beauty who is mellowing well.  She smiles at
him.  Perhaps a certain tinge of sadness about her,
because they don't have children.

ADAM
(happy to see her)
She's ready.

BARBARA
(eyeing the model)
It looks great.

ADAM
(nodding)
Thanks.

She pushes a wrapped present across the table.

BARBARA
Happy vacation, honey!

Adam smiles and gives her a present he's hidden under
the table.  He opens his present.  A can of furniture
oil.

ADAM
Manchurian Tung oil?
(playfully grabs
Barbara and kisses
her)
Where did you get it?

BARBARA
Helen got it for me in Oslo.
There's enough to refinish the
gateleg table and the cherry
wardrobe...

Adam hands Barbara a carefully-wrapped bundle -- she
unwraps her gift... rolls of very expensive floral
wallpaper.  She cradles it in her arms like gold leaf.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam... it's beautiful.

Adam nods, and embraces her.

ADAM
Enough to do the guest room...

BARBARA
(cooing)
I'm so glad we're spending our
vacation at home...
(with a sudden resolve)
... I'm going to get started right
now!

ADAM
(pulling her back)
Whoa!... hold on...

Barbara calms down, returning to Adam's embrace... as:

PHONE RINGS -- They freeze, then grin.

ADAM & BARBARA
(unison)
No one's home!

HONK HONK outside.  They look at each other horrified.
Peer out the window.

BARBARA
Oh no.

ADAM
(pointing at her)
It's your turn, darling.

She shakes her head with resignation and goes downstairs.
KNOCKING on door from below.


INT. STAIRCASE AND KITCHEN - DAY

CAMERA FOLLOWS Adam and Barbara downstairs.  We see the
rambling, old fashioned quality to the house.

Clean, sentimental, warm and floral.  Some rooms in
progress.  They continue down the main staircase past
photos of themselves, old photos of the early days of
Winter River, pictures and mementos of three
generations in hardware.  Barbara goes to the kitchen
and Adam continues down to the basement.


HER POV - A WOMAN

JANE BUTTERFIELD -- tall, gawky and aggressive peeks in
the kitchen door.  She's divorced three husbands and
buried another for good measure.  She's ruthless but is
weirdly, seamlessly pleasant.  She waves a legal sized
paper at them, starts to come inside.


INT./EXT. KITCHEN DOOR

Barbara makes dash for it and holds it just as Jane gets
a foot in.  Jane smiles wildly.

JANE
Hi, Barb!  I'm glad I caught you.
I heard you were on vacation!

BARBARA
That's right, Jane.  Complete
vacation.

JANE
Honey -- today I am three hundred
fifty thousand dollars!

BARBARA
No!  Jane, it is 6:45 in the
morning!

JANE
Look at me, think of me as cash!
This offer is really real!  From a
rich man in New York City who only
saw a photograph!
(rattles on)
My buyer has just made a killing
in condos in Manhattan, but he's
got a little stress problem...
(taps her head)
... so -- he wants to bring the
wife and kid for the old peace and
quiet.

BARBARA
That's what we're looking for,
too.

JANE
Barbara Maitland, sweetie, just
listen now.  This house is too
big.  It really ought to be for a
couple with a family.

That hurts Barbara a little.  She looks at Jane.

JANE
(continuing)
Oh, honey... I didn't mean
anything... it's just too big for
you.

Jane compulsively affixes her business card, face inside.
in the windowpane.

BARBARA
(shutting door)
'Bye, Jane, see you in a few
weeks.


ADAM

is humming happily, looking for paint brushes in the
ground floor storeroom.  He spies a cassette deck and
looks through a stack of cassettes and plays one.  It
is an old INKSPOTS LOVE SONG.


INT. GUEST ROOM - DAY

Barbara is starting to paper the walls already.  She
frowns at the MUSIC.  Goes to the door.

BARBARA
Oh, honey.  You said no Inkspots
on this vacation!

It CLICKS OFF.  She goes back into the room.


INT. STOREROOM - DAY

Adam puts away the tape but keeps humming the song.  He
opens the shutters on a small window.  ON WINDOW...

JANE
(her huge face
grinning at him)
Boo!

He jumps back, frightened.

ADAM
No, Jane.

Adam closes the shutters as Jane affixes yet another
card to the window.  He continues his search for a
brush.


JANE

exits jauntily, flapping her contract down the lawn.


INT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Adam continues rummaging for a brush.  Can't find it.

ADAM
(calling to distant
Barbara)
Honey, come with me down to the
store?

BARBARA (O.S.)
What for?

ADAM
I need a good brush for this Tung
oil and I want to pick up a piece
of the model.  Let's go early
before anyone sees us.

Barbara has already papered a few rolls in the guest
room.

BARBARA
Okay, but let's hurry back.  You
just run in okay?


EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY

The Victorian house from the model ""in the flesh.""
Adam stands by the station wagon.

On the bumper of the car is a sticker reading:
WARNING:  I BRAKE FOR ANIMALS.

Barbara gets in driver's side.  They drive off.


INT. THE CAR - DAY

Adam dusts the inside of the dashboard.  Clean Clean.

BARBARA
(preoccupied)
Jane said we should sell the house
to someone with a family.

ADAM
Ah, the ever-tactful Jane.

Puts his hand on her shoulder.


EXT. THE RIVER AND BRIDGE AND HILL - DAY

We see the car coming down the hill toward the bridge.

ADAM (V.O.)
We should be flattered that she
wants to sell our house.

BARBARA (V.O.)
I know... I just wish she'd leave
us alone.

ADAM (V.O.)
Let's not think about it.  We'll
have a nice romantic, quiet,
vacation.  Here comes the bridge
chorus.

Car reaches the rickety covered bridge.  Car shakes,
bobbing up and down on every plank.

ON Barbara and Adam TIGHT -- (they've done this routine
before).  They sing an old Johnny Mathis song.  With a
lot of vibrato.

TOGETHER
Chances are... When I wear a
foolish grin...

They laugh.


EXT. DOWNTOWN WINTER RIVER - DAY

Just like the model, but real.  And populated.

CAMERA PAUSES ON a gorgeous storefront with a brass
lion out front.  Sign above doors says --

BOZMAN BUILDING 1835

An old man polishes the lion as Maitlands drive by and
wave.

BARBARA (V.O.)
Wave at the lion.

ADAM (V.O.)
Don't forget the balls, Ernie.

BARBARA (V.O.)
(embarrassed)
Adam!

Ernie looks around to see no one's looking and polishes
the balls of the lion.


CAMERA SPIES A JAUNTY DOG

like Benji, peeing on the opposite corner of the lion.
Maitlands drive by store with sign:

JANE BUTTERFIELD
ANTIQUES
REAL ESTATE
TRAVEL


INT. ANTIQUE STORE REAL ESTATE OFFICE TRAVEL AGENCY -
DAY

The store is bursting with antiques of all sorts,
travel brochures, photographs of houses for sale, and a
serve-yourself Xerox machine.  LITTLE JANE, her eight-
year-old daughter is drudgingly making copies.

Jane, phone in hand, rushes to the window to watch
Maitlands drive by.  Almost popping the cord when it
reaches its end.  She's waiting for the other party to
pick up.

JANE
Y... ello.  Mrs. Deetz?  Well the
condition is what we country folk
call, fixin'... Yes, I think they
are fixin' to accept another
offer.  Well maybe if you offer
390,000 they'll take it.


EXT. MAITLAND HARDWARE - DAY

Adam sprints up the steps of his lovely hardware store.
OLD BILL, a slightly-addled ancient barber, is napping
in a chair in front of his shop, next door to Adam's.
Adam fumbles with the lock, not interested in conver-
sation.  He drops his keys, waking Old Bill.

OLD BILL
'Morning, Adam.  You need a
haircut before your vacation?

ADAM
No thanks, Bill.

OLD BILL
How's the model coming?

ADAM
Good, Bill -- Good.

Bill turns around and continues prattling even though
Adam has entered.  Bill prattles throughout.

OLD BILL
Y'know, I was thinkin'... you said
Bozman built the foundation in
1835 but y'know his grandson came
in here last week and said he
found a bottle with an 1836 stamp
in it plastered in the foundation.
(suddenly disgusted
at the memory)
He's got hair down to his
goddamned shoulders...


INT. MAITLAND HARDWARE

Adam pulls down a few good paintbrushes and carefully
picks up a small model of the Bozman building.  He
walks out.  Old Bill continues unabated.

OLD BILL
He said ""Just give me a trim..."" I
took a scissors to him so fast...
would've skimmed him clean if he
hadn't...

Adam strides by quickly to the car.

ADAM
See you, Bill.

OLD BILL
Right.


EXT. MAITLAND'S CAR - DAY

The Maitlands drive their car out of town.


ON JANE


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE - DAY

Car approaches.


INT. CAR - DAY

Five brushes sit on the seat next to Adam.  He cradles
small replica of the Bozman building, complete with
brass lion.

BARBARA
It's a beauty.

ADAM
Yeah it turned out okay.  We
applied for a historical plaque
for it.  That'll be the third one
on Main Street.

BARBARA
(jokingly)
With all these historical
landmarks in town, where are they
going to put the condominiums?

ADAM
(grinning)
Slow down there, honey... I don't
want the vibration to weaken the
model.

BARBARA
(nervous)
Oh... I'm sorry...

Barbara starts to apply the brakes.

Just before the bridge the dog waddles out in the road.
Stops to pee.  Barbara swerves.  As the car hits the
rickety bridge, the speed is just a bit too much.

Boards RATTLE and loosen, the car skews and catches in
an open slot, careens to the right, then the left and
the bridge.


INT. CAR - DAY

A piling has smashed through the window on the pas-
senger side, crushing the upper part of Barbara's
arm.  She is wailing in pain and fright.

Adam tries to help Barbara.  He tries to get out of the
car.  None of this succeeds.


EXT. BRIDGE AND RIVER - DAY

The dog finishes, looks over at the car, walks across
the bridge and steps on the one board which holds the
car aloft.

The car rocks back and forth for a moment, and then
slides forward toward the water.


EXT. CAR AND BRIDGE

The car plunges into the rushing water.  It floats
for a moment, and then sinks like a stone.

FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN:

INT. BARBARA AND ADAM'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

Quiet, still, expectant.  There is a fire laid in the
hearth.  Suddenly and for no apparent reason it ignites
and burns with a furious cheerfulness.

Barbara and Adam enter, dazed, wet, and bedraggled.

BARBARA
Something like this always happens
when we try to go on vacation.
Always.

Adam leads her toward the fire.

ADAM
You'll feel better when you're
dry.

He holds out his hands to be warmed.  Barbara comes up
beside him.  All this time she's been holding her
injured arm with the other hand.

BARBARA
This fire wasn't burning when we
left the house.

ADAM
How's your arm?

BARBARA
I'm not sure.  It feels... frozen.

She holds her arms out to warm them.  One hand catches
on fire.


BARBARA'S LEFT ARM

They stare at it dumbfoundedly before Adam regains his
senses and snatches it out of the fire.  Two of the
fingers are burning like candles, and Barbara indus-
triously blows them out.

BARBARA
Oh, Adam.

CUT TO:


INT. LIVING ROOM:  A FEW MINUTES LATER - DAY

They are sitting on the couch together.  Barbara is
looking away slightly -- as one does when a doctor is
drawing blood -- while Adam looks at her fingers.  He
frowns.

He looks at his skin.  It is pale.  He looks at
Barbara.

ADAM
You'd better sit down, hon.

BARBARA
I am sitting.

ADAM
I'll tell you what, Barbara.  I
don't think we survived that
crash.

BARBARA
(pause)
Oh, Adam.  We're home.  In our own
house.  Nonsense.  I'll make some
coffee.  You get some more
firewood.

Adam gets up, a little absently, she follows him as he
wanders to the front door.  He peers out.

ADAM
Let's take things extra slow.  Do
you remember how we got back up
here?

Barbara tests her hand, clenches and unclenches her
fist.

BARBARA
I'm fine.  My arm works fine.

Adam, exploring, opens the door, steps out on the front
porch.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - TWILIGHT

Adam's face is painted with color of sunset.  He stands
atop the steps leading down to the front yard.  Barbara
stands just inside the open threshold, looking out
worriedly.

BARBARA
(quiet sarcasm)
The end of a perfect day.

Adam starts to step down to the yard.

ADAM
Honey, I'm gonna go down to the
bridge and retrace our steps.

He steps off the last step into the yard and promptly
disappears.

BARBARA
Adam!


EXT. THE GREAT VOID

Adam is nowhere.  There's no ground, no sky, nothing to
stand on or hold onto or give boundaries or distance.
Just vast nothing.  Not white and not colored either.
NOISE OF A CLOCK TICKING.

Adam looks about surprised, doesn't like what he
doesn't see.  He turns around to head back up the
steps.  There are no steps.

ADAM
Barbara?

His VOICE ECHOES STRANGELY.  He runs off a little in
the distance, and calls again from over there.

ADAM
(continuing; quietly)
Where are you?

He goes even farther away.


IN THE FOREGROUND

an enormous geared wheel -- the size of a man -- rolls
by, tearing up the unseamed ground.  Something pours up
out of the tear -- ooze or stuffing.

Adam runs forward and stares after the wheel, which is
now out of sight.


TWO SMALLER GEARS

looking very much like components of a giant watch --
spin along behind him.  One of them veers suddenly
toward him, and though Adam jumps out of the way, the
gear snags his trouser leg and shreds it.  LOUD
TICKING.


A PERFECTLY ENORMOUS GEAR

comes barreling toward him.  Adam leaps out of its
way.  The gear turns, fish-tailing, kicking up ooze and
stuffing.

Adam flings himself suddenly to the right, but trips
into the path of the gear.  As he's about to be
crushed, he's suddenly jerked up to safety.


EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT

It's Barbara who's grabbed him, and quite evidently
saved his life -- not life, perhaps -- but existence.
He's shaken, breathless.

Barbara stares at him, as if wondering what he's just
been through.

ADAM
(weakly)
You saved my -- uh -- life... or
whatever...

BARBARA
Two hours.

ADAM
What?

BARBARA
That's how long you were gone.

ADAM
(pondering that)
... Hmmm?


INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Barbara leads Adam into the house.

ADAM
Anything happen while I was away?

BARBARA
Yes, it did.  Yes, it did.  I made
a couple of small discoveries.


BARBARA

stands by the mirror over the hearth mantle.  On the
mantle is Barbara's prize collection of porcelain
horses.  Adam comes to stand beside her.  They look
into the mirror, and there is no reflection of them.

Barbara picks up one of the horses, and trots it through
the air.  The horse is imaged in the mirror.

BARBARA
(continuing)
There's that, and there's this.

She picks up an ancient, leather-bound book.  It's
yellow and worn, about the size of the Boy Scout
manual.

CLOSEUP:  Its title is HANDBOOK FOR THE RECENTLY
DECEASED.

ADAM
(reading)
Handbook for the recently
diseased.

BARBARA
Deceased.  I don't know where it
came from.  Look at the publisher.

ADAM
(he does and reads)
Handbook for the Recently Deceased
Press.

BARBARA
(finally admit-
ting it)
I don't think we survived the
crash.


INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Adam is already in bed, reading from the handbook.
Barbara is getting ready for bed -- going through a
ritual of sorts that they practiced every night of
their married lives.

BARBARA
I don't like situations like this.
I hate it when I'm not in control.
So just tell me the basics.

ADAM
This book isn't arranged that
way.  What do you want to know?

BARBARA
There are a thousand things... Why
did you disappear when you walked
off the front porch?  Is this a
punishment?  Are we halfway to
heaven or are we halfway to hell?
And how long is this going to
last?

ADAM
I don't see anything about
""Rewards and Punishments"" or
""Heaven and Hell.""
(frustrated)
This book reads like stereo
instructions!  Listen to this...
'Geographical and Temporal
Perimeters... Functional
perimeters vary from manifestation
to manifestation.""  This is going
to take some time.


BARBARA

paces, she trips on her wallpaper rolls.  Kicks them.

BARBARA
I knew I'd never finish the guest
room.  Adam, we just can't stay in
here forever!

They look at each other, the question hangs in the air.
Can't they?

Adam stands and walks to the window.

ADAM
(thoughtfully)
Maybe we should set up a normal
routine.

She looks at him like he's nuts.

ADAM
(continuing)
I mean, let's try to nail down
something in our lives.  A regular
schedule.  We can keep track of
time and go on with our projects
up here in the attic.

She shakes her head, exasperated.  Flops down on the
bed.

BARBARA
Oh, God, maybe this is all just a
bad dream.

ON ADAM - TIGHT - a somber look comes across his face.

ADAM
I'm afraid not, honey.

Barbara looks up at him, questioningly.

BARBARA
Why?  What's wrong?  Adam?

She stands and joins him at the window.


THEIR POV THROUGH THE WINDOW

In the distance we see an automobile funeral procession
threading its way toward the nearby cemetery.  Head-
lights are on.  We recognize Jane's car in the line.


REVERSE ON BARBARA AND ADAM

somber faces.


TIGHTER ON PROCESSION

It arrives at the gravesite.  We see some familiar
faces, Ernie, and Old Bill the Barber.  Jane and little
Jane watch as two identical coffins are carried to-
gether, to two open graves.


ON BARBARA AND ADAM

She drops her head sadly on his shoulder.  He leans his
face slightly into hers.

FADE OUT.


FADE IN:

INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam is setting up a small monument in the model town
cemetery.  It reads:  ADAM AND BARBARA MAITLAND/UNITED
IN LIFE/UNDIVIDED IN DEATH.

ADAM
I wish I had a better view of the
cemetery from up here.  I don't
know which area is the best
placement for us.

Barbara, trying to clean, lets out a frustrated YELP!
She paces.

ADAM
(continuing)
Cabin fever, han?

BARBARA
I can't clean anything.  The
vacuum is out in the garage.  I
can't leave the house.  Why don't
they tell us something?  Where are
all the other dead people in the
world?  Why is it just you and me?

ADAM
Maybe this is heaven.

BARBARA
(looking at the
dusty walls)
In heaven there wouldn't be dust
on the wallpaper.

ADAM
Hon... I didn't want to die, but
really, this is fine with me.
Look, we never have to wash dishes
again.

BARBARA
Dishes?  We haven't eaten in three
weeks!  Adam, I'm not like you.  I
really need to be around people,
get out to the church and go
grocery shopping.

ADAM
But I'm not hungry, are you?

Barbara shakes her head and picks up the Handbook and
pages through it desperately.

BARBARA
I keep having this feeling that
something has got to happen.

CAR DOOR SLAMS outside.  Adam and Barbara look at one
another.  Run to window.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane Butterfield is staring up at the old house.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Adam, from his angle, can just barely see her.

ADAM
God, it's Jane.

BARBARA
What's she doing here?

ADAM
I don't know.
(shouting)
Jane, Jane, up here!


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Unhearing, Jane heads for car.  SOUND OF WIND UP.
Blows her dress.  Little Jane straggles along with her
like an apprentice.


INT. ATTIC - DAY

Barbara watches Adam, and shakes her head.  He stops.

BARBARA
She can't see you, right?

Adam nods.

BARBARA
(continuing)
In the book, Rule Number Two:  the
living usually won't see the dead.

ADAM
Won't?  Or can't?

BARBARA
Just says ""won't.""  Wait a minute.
Here it says ""the living are
arrogant... they think they'll
never die, so they refuse to see
the dead.""

ADAM
Arrogant.  That's Jane all right...

Barbara sighs and nods.

BARBARA
At least we won't have to worry
about her.

Adam smiles and goes to his model.


EXT. MAITLAND HOUSE - DAY

Jane drives away.  CAMERA HINGES to see a FOR SALE
sign.  Across it -- another smaller banner.  It reads:
SOLD!

CUT TO:


INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING

The Maitlands are asleep.  CAMERA EXPLORES the room a
bit.  It is getting slightly tatty.  Adam rolls over,
pulling the covers off Barbara.  We see:

ON BARBARA -- she is hovering off the side of the bed.

An OMINOUS RUMBLE -- like a 4.0 earthquake shakes
the house.  GLASS RATTLES, the ceramic horses on the
mantelpiece jump around.  Barbara falls to the floor.
They look at one another with horror.  They leap up and
run downstairs.


INT.  LIVING ROOM - DAY

The RUMBLE BUILDS TO A CLIMAX, there is a LOUD METALLIC
SQUEAL, and then a CRASH... just as Barbara and Adam
arrive.


THE FRONT DOOR

smashes open revealing a moving van ramp.


A TEN-FOOT ELECTRIC-BLUE ITALIAN LEATHER COUCH

slides smoothly down the ramp.  On the couch sits DELIA
DEETZ.

The couch CRASHES into the base of the staircase,
smashing the newel post and several of the balusters.
Barbara cringes.  One of the balusters falls at Delia's
side.  She grasps it like a scepter.

Two MOVING MEN rush down the ramp.

MOVING MAN #1
Sorry about that, Mrs. Deetz.

DELIA
Don't worry.  It was going anyway.

Delia is relentlessly New York, relentlessly fashion-
able, relentlessly thin -- totally self assured.

She is also a woman with a mission -- to gut Barbara
and Adam's house and remake it in her own very upscale
image.

Delia's gaze is on the living room, but she looks
through Adam and Barbara as if they weren't even there
(which to her eyes they're not).

Still holding the baluster, Delia gets up off the couch
and moves into the living room, surveying it with an
odd mixture of ambition, and resolution.


BEHIND HER

the two Moving Men bring in a matching blue leather
armchair.  In the armchair sits LYDIA DEETZ.

Lydia, age 14, is a pretty girl, but wan, pale and
overly-dramatic, dressed as she is in her favorite
color, black.  She's a combination of a little death
rocker and an 80's version of Edward Gorey's little
girls.

She has a couple of expensive cameras around her neck
-- and is already taking photographs of the moving
men.  Lydia is cool, Lydia is sullen, Lydia is her
father's daughter by his first marriage.  Lydia is
usually about half-pissed off.  But underneath... we
like her a lot.

The Moving Men still hold up the chair, waiting for
Delia to decide where she wants it.

DELIA
(continuing)
Jesus.  Who lived here?  The
Waltons?

TIGHT ON Lydia -- calmly surveys the house.

Delia signals wearily that the Moving Men can put the
chair down anywhere.

DELIA
(continuing)
Get all this other crap out of
here.

Lydia hops down out of the chair, and comes farther
into the living room.

DELIA
(continuing)
Where is your father?... probably
in the kitchen.

That's the cue for CHARLES DEETZ, who comes in through
the swinging door, and across the dining room... a ner-
vous but basically pleasant man, CHARLES DEETZ is
intent on attacking rest and relaxation with the same
vengeance that earned him millions in real estate.

CHARLES
The noise in that kitchen.  Noisy
refrigerator, noisy faucets...
We'll have to replace it all.  I
want no humming in the house.


LYDIA

exploring on her own, gazes around the living room with
growing pleasure, she backs up for a good angle to
photograph.

CAMERA HINGES -- She is standing with her back right up
to Barbara -- who is horrified at this creature.

Charles enters.

CHARLES
(to Lydia)
What do you think, honey?

LYDIA
Delia hates it.

Lydia gazes at a dusty maze of spider webs.

LYDIA
(continuing)
I could live here.

A movement makes Lydia turn around and scream.  It is
Delia.  Not Barbara.

DELIA
Settle down, Lydia.  I wonder
where we are going to get
counseling for you out here.

A VIOLENT FALSETTO SCREAM turns the Deetz family's
attention to the front windows.

OTHO (O.S.)
Help!  Oh help!


OTHO'S MASSIVE BODY

Wedged in the window frame.  The short, stubby legs,
dressed in the world's largest pair of Georgia Armani
slacks, protrude into the living room, waving fran-
tically.  Expensive Italian loafers are kicked off the
feet, revealing a pair of expensive patterned socks.
By their feet shall ye know them.

DELIA
It's Otho!

CHARLES
Otho, why didn't you just come in
the door?

Otho's voice comes as if from a great distance.

OTHO (O.S.)
It's bad luck.  And I believe
hugely in luck.

DELIA
Hold your breath and we'll pull.

Delia turns to Charles and Lydia for help -- doesn't
get it -- and at last pulls Otho into the living room
single-handedly.

All this while the Moving Men are variously carting out
the handsome old furniture and bringing in the hideous
new furniture.

Otho is Robert Morley at his most obscenely fat and
faggoty.  But he's not all fat and fun -- this customer
carries nasty emotional weight as well.


OTHO

holds onto the curtains for support as he is pulled
through the window.  And when he is at last all the way
through, and upright on his feet, he suddenly gives a
tremendous yank.  The whole drapery apparatus,
including valences, crashes to the floor.

OTHO
That was the single most
unattractive window treatment I
have ever seen in the entire of my
existence.

DELIA
(starry eyed)
I'm so glad you could leave the
city to consult me, Otho.

Otho is looking around the room with an eye of quiet
horror.

OTHO
Yes, of course you are.  Well,
Otho had an intuition.  Call it a
hunch -- that it was going to be a
fabled monstrosity of a house.
And it certainly is.  Charles,
you're lucky the yuppies are
buying condos, so you can afford
what I'm going to have to do to
this place.  We are talking from
the ground ups'ville!

CHARLES
That's fine, Otho.  Just keep me
out of it.  I am here to relax and
clip coupons.  And goddamnit, I
mean to do it.

He exits to find solace in a quiet corner of his house.
During this speech, Otho has been surreptitiously pos-
ing for Lydia's camera.  She clicks the shutter.

OTHO
(ignoring her)
Is the rest of the house as bad as
this?

DELIA
The rest of the house is probably
worse.  When can you and I get
started?

OTHO
No time like the present, as my
wicked stepmother used to say.

Out of the pockets of his size 56 Georgia Armani
jacket, Otho takes two cans of spray paint -- the kind
the graffiti artists use -- and shakes them as if they
were castanets.  They certainly sound like it.

OTHO
Delia, let's get this show on the
road.


INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY

At one end, near the stairs leading up to the attic,
Barbara and Adam are slumped against opposite walls.

BARBARA
Adam, we are in hell.  I hate
these people.

ADAM
They make Jane look good.

BARBARA
Is this a punishment for something
we did in life?  What can we do?

ADAM
(determined)
We're not completely helpless.
I've been reading the book.
There's a word for people in our
predicament, honey.

Barbara looks at him.

BARBARA
(continuing)
Ghosts!

Barbara is shocked at the reality.

Otho and Delia come up the stairs at the end of the
hallway.

OTHO
We're dealing with negative
entertainment potential here.  I
mean, there's absolutely no organic
walking flow-through.

Otho looks down the hallway.  It's empty.  Adam and
Barbara are no longer there.

DELIA
What's wrong?

OTHO
I thought I saw something.

DeLia turns and spray-paints on the wall -- in luminous
orange -- the word MAUVE.

DELIA
Okay?

OTHO
(screaming with delight)
You read my mind!  I love clients
who can read my mind.  I don't
think people realize how strong a
connection there is between
interior design and the
supernatural.

DELIA
(fawning)
I know... I read your book, The
Haunted Tapestries of the Waldorf.

OTHO
Gooood!

Delia opens the door and they step inside another room.

DELIA
This will be Lydia's room.


INT. LYDIA'S ROOM - DAY

It's not Lydia's room yet, of course, because it still
has the Maitlands' furniture in it.  Barbara had partly
wallpapered it before the accident.  Her tools are still
there.

DELIA
What do you think?

OTHO
Viridian?

DELIA
Viridian?  What is...?

Otho spray-paints the word VIRIDIAN on the wall -- plus
the word BLUE GREEN -- and Cr2 03, right over a picture
of Adam and Barbara as kids.

OTHO
Blue-green!  Hydrated chromic
oxide!  Remember I'm schooled in
chemistry.  I was a hair analyst!
Briefly.  Interior design is a
science, Delia!  Think of me as
Doctor Otho.
(looking at wall)
And this patient is truly sick!

DELIA
Of course, her favorite color!
How beautiful!

Delia smiles.  Behind Delia and Otho, the room's closet
door swings slowly open with and ominous CREAK.


DELIA AND OTHO

turn that way, with a suggestion of dread.  Inside the
closet, Barbara's corpse is suspended from the ceiling
by a belt.  The corpse twists with a CREAK, and Barbara
grins ghostly -- and slowly tears off her face, leaving
nothing but muscle and bone beneath.  Her eyeballs
dangle on her cheeks.

Delia and Otho stare aghast.

DELIA
Oh my God!

OTHO
We just have to pray that the
other closets are bigger than this
one.

He walks over.  Looks inside.

OTHO
(continuing)
Were these people dwarfes? (sic)
(spies something)
Oooooo!...  Look!

He finds, neatly hung in plastic, the Maitlands'
wedding outfits.  Totally captivated by this powerful
image, he peers through the plastic at them.  Holding
each up to Delia.  Barbara watches wide-eyed at them.

OTHO
(continuing)
Ozzie...
(holding up
her dress)
... and... Harriet!  What happened
to these people?

Delia slams the door in Barbara's contorted face.

DELIA
They died.


INT. HOUSE - SAME TIME

Delia and Otho come out of Lydia's bedroom and go
through the bathroom.  Disgusted, they continue on to
the study.


OTHO

reaches out and turns the knob.  The door swings omi-
nously open on Charles' study.  This had been Adam's
reading and birdwatching study.  Bird posters on the
wall, books everywhere.  Straight out of Better Homes
and Gardens 1963.

OTHO
Ooo.  Deliver me from L.L. Bean!


ANGLE

There is one slight difference, however, because on the
rag rug in the middle of the floor lies Adam's headless
corpse.  Standing over him, holding in one hand a long
knife and in the other Adam's blood-and-gore dripping
head is Barbara -- with a maniacal look on her face.
Behind them, Charles is thumbing through Adam's Audubon
collection.  He sits up like a cornered animal protect-
ing his territory.

CHARLES
(to Otho and Delia)
This room is off limits.  I don't
want either of you to touch one
piece of furniture in here.  This
is my room.


INSIDE THE ROOM

The eyes of Adam's severed head open and look up at
Barbara -- she stops screaming.

ADAM'S HEAD
They don't see us.  They can't
hear us.

Outside, Delia is shaking her head.

DELIA
The woman who lived here had the
aesthetic instincts of Betty
Crocker.

BARBARA
I'm going to get her.

DELIA
I cannot convey to you the extent
to which this house bores me.

OTHO
(looking around
scientifically)
Once you cover up the wallpaper,
knock down a few walls, alter the
traffic patterns, and -- perhaps
-- think about an inground pool --
the place might just be livable.
What's on the third floor?

DELIA
Attic space.

OTHO
Let's see.  We could turn that
into a media room.

They head up the stars to the attic.


INT. STUDY - SAME TIME

Adam's head has a look of terror on it.

ADAM'S HEAD
Oh, God.  I forgot to lock the
attic door!

Adam's headless body jumps up off the floor and rushes
out of the room.


INT. STAIRCASE TO ATTIC - SAME TIME

Otho and Delia climbing.  The headless corpse careens
past them, around the bend in the stairs and out of
sight.

Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah
Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah

[Verse 3]
Open the curtain
And let in some sky
It's almost half past two and you
You can tell by the light
Open your window
And let in the atmosphere, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Let it break through, oh, let it break through
Oh, let it break through, oh yeah

Hm, hmm

[Verse 1]
There's fifty-two ways to murder anyone
One and two are the same and they both work as well
I'm coming clean for Amy
Julie doesn't scream as well and the cops won't listen all night
And so maybe I'll be over
Just as soon as I fill them all in

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can remember when I saw her last
We were runnin' all around and havin' a blast, havin' a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in is so lonely without you
I know when you're home, I was thinkin' about you
There was somethin' I forgot to say, I was cryin' on Saturday night

[Chorus]
I was out cruisin' without you
They were playin' our song
Cryin' on Saturday night

[Verse 2]
As the moon becomes the night time
You go viciously, quietly, away
I'm sitting in the bedroom
Where we used to sit and smoke cigarettes
Now I'm watchin', watchin' you die
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I can remember when I saw her last
We were runnin' all around and havin' a blast
But the back seat of the drive-in is so lonely without you
I know when you're home, I was thinkin' about you
There was somethin' I forgot to say, I was cryin' on Saturday night

[Chorus]
I was out cruisin' without you
They were playin' our song
Cryin' on Saturday night
Cryin' on Saturday night

Love is tragic, love is bold
You will always do what you are told
Love is hard, love is strong
You will never say that you were wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know when I got bitter
But love is surely better when it's gone

[Chorus]
'Cause you wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live
You wanted more
More than I could bear
More than I could offer
For a love that isn't there

[Verse 2]
Love is color, love is loud
Love is never saying you're too proud
Love is trusting, love is honest
Love is not a hand to hold you down

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I got to pick me up when I am down
I got to get my feet back on the ground
I got to pick me up when I am down

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Chorus 2]
You wanted more
More than I could love
More than I could offer
The harder you would shove
You wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live",1999,90s
